<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Preface.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Millions of young people in America are being educated, and hence
there is a very great demand for a Standard Work showing how to
express written thought in the most elegant manner and how to
read and recite in a way that insures the greatest success. To meet this
enormous demand is the aim of this volume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part I.—How to Write a Composition.</span>—The treatment of this subject is
masterly and thorough, and is so fascinating that the study becomes a delight.
Rules and examples are furnished for the right choice of words, for constructing
sentences, for punctuation, for acquiring an elegant style of composition, for
writing essays and letters, what authors should be read, etc. The directions
given are all right to the point and are easily put into practice.</p>

<p>The work contains a complete list of synonyms, or words of similar meaning,
and more than 500 choice subjects for compositions, which are admirably suited
to persons of all ages. These are followed by a charming collection of Masterpieces
of Composition by such world-renowned authors as Emerson, Hawthorne,
George Eliot, Lord Macaulay, Washington Irving, C. H. Spurgeon, Sarah J.
Lippincott, Mrs. Stowe and many others.</p>

<p>These grand specimens of composition bear the stamp of the most brilliant
genius. They are very suggestive and helpful. They inspire the reader to the
noblest efforts, and teach the truth of Bulwer Lytton’s well-known saying that
“The pen is mightier than the sword.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part II.—Readings and Recitations.</span>—The second part of this incomparable
work is no less valuable, and a candid perusal will convince you that it contains
the largest and best collection of recitations ever brought together in one
volume. These are of every variety and description. Be careful to notice that
every one of these selections, which are from the writings of the world’s best
authors, is especially adapted for reading and reciting. This is something which
cannot be said of any similar work.</p>

<p>All the Typical Gestures used in Reciting are shown by choice engravings,
and the reader has in reality the best kind of teacher right before him. The different
attitudes, facial expressions and gestures are both instructive and charming.
These are followed by Recitations with Lesson Talks. Full directions are
given for reciting the various pieces, and this is done by taking each paragraph
or verse of the selection and pointing out the gestures, tone of voice, emphasis,
etc., required to render it most effectively. The Lesson Talks render most valuable
service to all who are studying the grand art of oratory.</p>

<p>The next section of this masterly volume contains Recitations with Music.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
This is a choice collection of readings which are rendered most effective by
accompaniments of music, enabling the reader by the use of the voice or some
musical instrument to entrance his audience.</p>

<p>These charming selections are followed by a superb collection of Patriotic
Recitations which celebrate the grand victories of our army and navy in the
Philippines and West Indies. These incomparable pieces are all aglow with
patriotic fervor and are eagerly sought by all elocutionists.</p>

<p>There is space here only to mention the different parts of this delightful
volume, such as Descriptive and Dramatic Recitations; Orations by Famous
Orators; a peerless collection of Humorous and Pathetic Recitations, and Recitations
for Children and Sunday Schools.</p>

<p>Parents are charmed with this volume because it furnishes what the little
folks want and is a self-educator for the young. It marks a new era in book
publishing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part III.—Programmes for Special Occasions.</span>—These have been prepared
with the greatest care in order to meet a very urgent demand. The work contains
Programmes for Fourth of July; Christmas Entertainments; Washington’s
Birthday; Decoration Day; Thanksgiving Day; Arbor Day; Public School and
Parlor Entertainments; Harvest Home; Flower Day, etc. Beautiful Selections
for Special Occasions are contained in no other work, and these alone insure
this very attractive volume an enormous sale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dialogues, Tableaux, etc.</span>—Added to the Rich Contents already described
is a Charming Collection of Dialogues and Tableaux for public and private entertainments.
These are humorous, pithy, <span class="smcap">teach important lessons</span> and are
thoroughly enjoyed by everybody.</p>

<p>In many places the winter lyceum is an institution; we find it not only in
academies, and normal schools, but very frequently the people in a district
or town organize a debating society and discuss the popular questions of the day.
The benefit thus derived cannot be estimated. In the last part of this volume
will be found by-laws for those who wish to conduct lyceums, together with a
choice selection of subjects for debate.</p>

<p>Thus it is seen that this is a very comprehensive work. Not only is it carefully
prepared, not only does it set a very high standard of excellence in composition
and elocution, but it is a work peculiarly fitted to the wants of millions of
young people throughout our country. The writer of this is free to say that such
a work as this would have been of inestimable value to him while obtaining an
education. All wise parents who wish to make the best provision for educating
their children should understand that they have in this volume such a teacher in
composition and oratory as has never before been offered to the public.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The correct and pleasing expression of
one’s thoughts in writing is an accomplishment
of the highest order.
To have little or no ability in the art of
composition is a great misfortune.</p>

<p>Who is willing to incur the disgrace and
mortification of being unable to write a
graceful and interesting letter, or an essay
worthy to be read by intelligent persons?
What an air of importance belongs to the
young scholar, or older student, who can pen
a production excellent in thought and beautiful
in language! Such a gifted individual
becomes almost a hero or heroine.</p>

<p>When I was a pupil in one of our public
schools the day most dreaded by all of the
scholars was “composition day.” What to
write about, and how to do it, were the most
vexatious of all questions. Probably nine-tenths
of the pupils would rather have mastered
the hardest lessons, or taken a sound
whipping, than to attempt to write one paragraph
of a composition on any subject.</p>

<p>While some persons have a natural faculty
for putting their thoughts into words, a much
larger number of others are compelled to
confess that it is a difficult undertaking, and
they are never able to satisfy themselves with
their written productions.</p>

<p>Let it be some encouragement to you to
reflect that many who are considered excellent
writers labored in the beginning under
serious difficulties, yet, being resolved to
master them, they finally achieved the most
gratifying success. When Napoleon was told
it would be impossible for his army to cross
the bridge at Lodi, he replied, “There is no
such word as impossible,” and over the
bridge his army went. Resolve that you
will succeed, and carry out this good resolution
by close application and diligent practice.

<h3>WHAT TO DO, AND HOW TO DO IT.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Study carefully the lessons contained
in the following pages.
They will be of great benefit, as
they show you what to do and how to do it.</p>

<p>These lessons are quite simple at first, and
are followed by others that are more advanced.
All of them have been carefully prepared
for the purpose of furnishing just such
helps as you need. You can study them by
yourself; if you can obtain the assistance of
a competent teacher, so much the better. I
predict that you will be surprised at the rapid
progress you are making. Perhaps you will
become fascinated with your study; at least,
it is to be hoped you will, and become enthusiastic
in your noble work.</p>

<p>Be content to take one step at a time. Do
not get the mistaken impression that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
will be able to write a good composition
before you have learned how to do it. Many
persons are too eager to achieve success
immediately, without patient and earnest
endeavor to overcome all difficulties.</p>

<p>Choose a subject for your composition that
is adapted to your capacity. You cannot
write on a subject that you know nothing
about. Having selected your theme, think
upon it, and, if possible, read what others
have written about it, not for the purpose of
stealing their thoughts, but to stimulate your
own, and store your mind with information.
Then you will be able to express in writing
what you know.</p>

<h4>The Treatment of the Subject.</h4>

<p>The principal reason why many persons
make such hard work of the art of composition
is that they have so few thoughts, and
consequently so little to say, upon the subjects
they endeavor to treat. The same rule
must be followed in writing a composition as
in building a house—you must first get your
materials.</p>

<p>I said something about stealing the
thoughts of others, but must qualify this by
saying that while you are learning to write,
you are quite at liberty in your practice to
make use of the thoughts of others, writing
them from memory after you have read a
page or a paragraph from some standard
author. It is better that you should remember
only a part of the language employed by
the writer whose thoughts you are reproducing,
using as far as possible words of your
own, yet in each instance wherein you
remember his language you need not hesitate
to use it. Such an exercise is a valuable aid
to all who wish to perfect themselves in the
delightful art of composition.</p>

<p>Take any writer of good English—J. G.
Holland, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Irving,
Cooper, or the articles in our best magazines—and
read half a page twice or thrice; close
the book, and write, in your own words,
what you have read; borrowing, nevertheless,
from the author so much as you can remember.
Compare what you have written with
the original, sentence by sentence, and word
by word, and observe how far you have fallen
short of the skilful author.</p>

<h4>A Frequent Change of Authors.</h4>

<p>You will thus not only find out your own
faults, but you will discover where they lie,
and how they may be mended. Repeat the
lesson with the same passages twice or
thrice, if your memory is not filled with the
words of the author, and observe, at each
trial, the progress you have made, not merely
by comparison with the original, but by comparison
with the previous exercises.</p>

<p>Do this day after day, changing your
author for the purpose of varying the style,
and continue to do so long after you have
passed on to the second and more advanced
stages of your training. Preserve all your
exercises, and occasionally compare the latest
with the earliest, and so ascertain what progress
you have made.</p>

<p>Give especial attention to the <i>words</i>, which,
to my mind, are of greater importance than
the sentences. Take your nouns first, and
compare them with the nouns used by your
author. You will probably find your words
to be very much bigger than his, more
sounding, more far-fetched, more classical,
or more poetical. All young writers and
speakers fancy that they cannot sufficiently
revel in fine words. Comparison with the
great masters of English will rebuke this
pomposity of inexperience, and chasten and
improve your style.</p>

<p>You will discover, to your surprise, that
our best writers eschew big words and do
not aim to dazzle their readers with fine
words. Where there is a choice, they prefer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the pure, plain, simple English noun—the
name by which the thing is known to
everybody, and which, therefore, is instantly
understood by all readers. These great
authors call a spade “a spade;” only small
scribblers term it “an implement of husbandry.”
If there is a choice of names,
good writers prefer the one best known,
while an inexperienced writer is apt to select
the most uncommon.</p>

<p>The example of the masters of the English
tongue should teach you that commonness
(if I may be allowed to coin a word to express
that for which I can find no precise
equivalent) and vulgarity are not the same in
substance. Vulgarity is shown in assumption
and affectation of language quite as
much as in dress and manners, and it is
never vulgar to be natural. Your object is
to be understood. To be successful, you
must write and talk in a language that everybody
can understand; and such is the natural
vigor, picturesqueness and music of
our tongue, that you could not possess yourself
of a more powerful or effective instrument
for expression.</p>

<h4>Right Choice of Words.</h4>

<p>It is well for you to be assured that while,
by this choice of plain English for the embodying
of your thoughts, you secure the
ears of ordinary people, you will at the same
time please the most highly educated and
refined. The <i>words</i> that have won the applause
of a political meeting are equally
successful in securing a hearing in Congress,
provided that the thoughts expressed and
the manner of their expression be adapted to
the changed audience.</p>

<p>Then for the <i>sentences</i>. Look closely at
their construction, comparing it with that of
your author; I mean, note how you have
put your words together. The placing of
words is next in importance to the choice of
them. The best writers preserve the natural
order of thought. They sedulously shun
obscurities and perplexities. They avoid
long and involved sentences. Their rule is,
that one sentence should express one thought,
and they will not venture on the introduction
of two or three thoughts, if they can help it.</p>

<h4>Obscure Sentences.</h4>

<p>Undoubtedly this is extremely difficult—sometimes
impossible. If you want to
qualify an assertion, you must do so on the
instant; but the rule should never be forgotten,
that a long and involved sentence is
to be avoided, wherever it is practicable to
do so.</p>

<p>Another lesson you will doubtless learn
from the comparison of your composition
with that of your model author. You will
see a wonderful number of <i>adjectives</i> in your
own writing, and very few in his. It is the besetting
sin of young writers to indulge in adjectives,
and precisely as a man gains experience
do his adjectives diminish in number.
It seems to be supposed by all unpracticed
scribblers that the multiplication
of epithets gives force. The nouns are never
left to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>It is curious to take up any newspaper
and read the paragraphs of news, to open
the books of nine-tenths of our authors of
the third and downward ranks. You will
rarely see a noun standing alone, without
one or more adjectives prefixed. Be assured
that this is a mistake. An adjective should
never be used unless it is essential to correct
description. As a general rule adjectives
add little strength to the noun they are set
to prop, and a multiplication of them is
always enfeebling. The vast majority of
nouns convey to the mind a much more accurate
picture of the thing they signify than
you can possibly paint by attaching epithets
to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Yet do not push to the extreme what has
just been said. Adjectives are a very important
part of language, and we could not
well do without them. You do not need to
say a “flowing river;” every river flows,
but you might wish to say a “swollen river,”
and you could not convey the idea you desire
to express without using the adjective
“swollen.” What I wish to caution you
against is the needless multiplication of adjectives,
which only serve to overload and
weaken the expression of your thought.</p>

<h4>Express Your Own Ideas.</h4>

<p>When you have repeated your lesson
many times, and find that you can write
with some approach to the purity of your
author, you should attempt an original composition.
In the beginning it would be prudent,
perhaps, to borrow the <i>ideas</i>, but to
put them into your own language. The
difficulty of this consists in the tendency of
the mind to mistake memory for invention,
and thus, unconsciously to copy the language
as well as the thoughts of the author.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid this is to translate
poetry into prose; to take, for instance, a
page of narrative in verse and relate the same
story in plain prose; or to peruse a page of
didactic poetry, and set down the argument
in a plain, unpoetical fashion. This will make
you familiar with the art of composition, only
to be acquired by practice; and the advantage,
at this early stage of your education in
the arts of writing and speaking, of putting
into proper language the thoughts of others
rather than your own is, that you are better
able to discover your faults. Your fatherly
love for your own ideas is such that you are
really incompetent to form a judgment of
their worth, or of the correctness of the language
in which they are embodied.</p>

<p>The critics witness this hallucination every
day. Books continually come to them, written
by men who are <i>not</i> mad, who probably
are sufficiently sensible in the ordinary business
of life, who see clearly enough the faults
of other books, who would have laughed
aloud over the same pages, if placed in their
hands by another writer, but who, nevertheless,
are utterly unable to recognize the absurdities
of their own handiwork. The reader
is surprised that any man of common intelligence
could indite such a maze of nonsense
where the right word is never to be found in
its right place, and this with such utter unconsciousness
of incapacity on the part of
the author.</p>

<h4>Write Exactly What You Mean.</h4>

<p>Still more is he amazed that, even if a sensible
man could so write, a sane man could
read that composition in print, and not with
shame throw it into the fire. But the explanation
is, that the writer knew what he <i>intended</i>
to say; his mind is full of <i>that</i>, and he
reads from the manuscript or the type, not
so much what is there set down, as what was
already floating in his own mind. To criticise
yourself you must, to some extent, forget
yourself. This is impracticable to many
persons, and, lest it may be so with you, I
advise you to begin by putting the thoughts
of others into your own language, before you
attempt to give formal expression to your
own thoughts.</p>

<p>You must habitually place your thoughts
upon paper—first, that you may do so rapidly;
and, secondly, that you may do so correctly.
When you come to write your reflections,
you will be surprised to find how
loose and inaccurate the most vivid of them
have been, what terrible flaws there are in
your best arguments.</p>

<p>You are thus enabled to correct them, and
to compare the matured sentence with the
rude conception of it. You are thus trained
to weigh your words and assure yourself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
that they precisely embody the idea you desire
to convey. You can trace uncouthness
in the sentences, and dislocations of thought,
of which you had not been conscious before.
It is far better to learn your lesson thus upon
paper, which you can throw into the fire unknown
to any human being, than to be
taught it by readers who are not always very
lenient critics and are quick to detect any
faults that appear in your production.</p>

<h3>READING AND THINKING.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="130" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Having accustomed yourself to express,
in plain words, and in clear,
precise and straightforward sentences,
the ideas of others, you
should proceed to express your own thoughts
in the same fashion. You will now see
more distinctly the advantage of having first
studied composition by the process I have
recommended, for you are in a condition to
discover the deficiencies in the flow of your
own ideas. You will be surprised to find,
when you come to put them into words, how
many of your thoughts were shapeless, hazy
and dreamy, slipping from your grasp when
you try to seize them, resolving themselves,
like the witches in Macbeth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">As breath into the wind.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h4>What You Should Read.</h4>

<p>Thus, after you have learned <i>how</i> to write,
you will need a good deal of education before
you will learn <i>what</i> to write. I cannot much
assist you in this part of the business. Two
words convey the whole lesson—<i>Read</i> and
<i>think</i>. What should you read? Everything.
What think about? All subjects that present
themselves. The writer and orator must be
a man of very varied knowledge. Indeed,
for all the purposes of practical life, you cannot
know too much. No learning is quite
useless. But a speaker, especially if an advocate,
cannot anticipate the subjects on
which he may be required to talk. Law is
the least part of his discourse. For once
that he is called upon to argue a point of
law, he is compelled to treat matters of fact
twenty times.</p>

<p>And the range of topics is very wide; it
embraces science and art, history and philosophy;
above all, the knowledge of human
nature that teaches how the mind he addresses
is to be convinced and persuaded, and
how a willing ear is to be won to his discourse.
No limited range of reading will
suffice for so large a requirement. The elements
of the sciences must be mastered; the
foundations of philosophy must be learned;
the principles of art must be acquired; the
broad facts of history must be stamped upon
the memory; poetry and fiction must not be
slighted or neglected.</p>

<h4>Our Great Writers.</h4>

<p>You must cultivate frequent and intimate
intercourse with the genius of all ages and
of all countries, not merely as standards by
which to measure your own progress, or as
fountains from which you may draw unlimited
ideas for your own use, but because they
are peculiarly <i>suggestive</i>. This is the characteristic
of genius, that, conveying one
thought to the reader’s mind, it kindles in
him many other thoughts. The value of this
to speaker and writer will be obvious to you.</p>

<p>Never, therefore, permit a day to pass
without reading more or less—if it be but a
single page—from some one of our great
writers. Besides the service I have described
in the multiplication of your ideas, it will
render you the scarcely lesser service of preserving
purity of style and language, and preventing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
you from falling into the conventional
affectations and slang of social dialogue.</p>

<p>For the same reason, without reference to
any higher motive, but simply to fill our
mind with the purest English, read daily
some portion of the Bible; for which exercise
there is another reason also, that its
phraseology is more familiar to all kinds of
audiences than any other, is more readily understood,
and, therefore, is more sufficient in
securing their attention.</p>

<h4>Three Kinds of Reading.</h4>

<p>Your reading will thus consist of three
kinds: reading for <i>knowledge</i>, by which I
mean the storing of your memory with facts;
reading for <i>thoughts</i>, by which I mean the
ideas and reflections that set your own mind
thinking; and reading the <i>words</i>, by which I
mean the best language in which the best
authors have clothed their thoughts. And
these three classes of reading should be pursued
together daily, more or less as you can,
for they are needful each to the others, and
neither can be neglected without injury to
the rest.</p>

<p>So also you must make it a business to
<i>think</i>. You will probably say that you are
always thinking when you are not <i>doing</i>
anything, and often when you are busiest.
True, the mind is active, but wandering,
vaguely from topic to topic. You are not in
reality <i>thinking out</i> anything; indeed, you cannot
be sure that your thoughts have a shape
until you try to express them in words.
Nevertheless you must think before you can
write or speak, and you should cultivate a
<i>habit of thinking</i> at all appropriate seasons.</p>

<p>But do not misunderstand this suggestion.
I do not design advising you to set yourself
a-thinking, as you would take up a book to
read at the intervals of business, or as a part
of a course of self-training; for such attempts
would probably begin with wandering fancies
and end in a comfortable nap. It is a fact
worth noting, that few persons can think
continuously while the body is at perfect rest.
The time for thinking is when you are kept
awake by some slight and almost mechanical
muscular exercise, and the mind is not busily
attracted by external subjects of attention.</p>

<p>Thus walking, angling, gardening, and
other rural pursuits are pre-eminently the
seasons for thought, and you should cultivate
a habit of thinking during those exercises,
so needful for health of body and for
fruitfulness of mind. <i>Then</i> it is that you
should submit whatever subject you desire
to treat to careful review, turning it on all
sides, and inside out, marshalling the facts
connected with it, trying what may be said
for or against every view of it, recalling what
you may have read about it, and finally
thinking what you could say upon it that
had not been said before, or how you could
put old views of it into new shapes.</p>

<h4>Learning to Think.</h4>

<p>Perhaps the best way to accomplish this
will be to imagine yourself writing upon it,
or making a speech upon it, and to think
what in such case you would say; I do not
mean in what <i>words</i> you would express
yourself, but what you would discourse
about; what ideas you would put forth; to
what thoughts you would give utterance.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this exercise you will
find your reflections extremely vague and
disconnected; you will range from theme
to theme, and mere flights of fancy will be
substituted for steady, continuous thought.
But persevere day by day, and that which
was in the beginning an effort will soon grow
into a habit, and you will pass few moments
of your working life in which, when not occupied
from without, your mind will not be
<i>usefully</i> employed within itself.</p>

<p>Having attained this habit of thinking, let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
it be a rule with you, before you write
or speak on any subject, to employ your
thoughts upon it in the manner I have described.
Go a-fishing. Take a walk. Weed
your garden. Sweep, dust, do any sewing
that needs to be done. While so occupied,
<i>think</i>. It will be hard if your own intelligence
cannot suggest to you how the subject
should be treated, in what order of argument,
with what illustrations, and with what new
aspects of it, the original product of your
own genius.</p>

<p>At all events this is certain, that without
preliminary reflection you cannot hope to
deal with any subject to your own satisfaction,
or to the profit or pleasure of others.
If you neglect these precautions, you can
never be more than a wind-bag, uttering
words that, however grandly they may roll,
convey no thoughts. There is hope for
ignorance; there is none for emptiness.</p>

<p>To sum up these rules and suggestions:
To become a writer or an orator, you must
fill your mind with knowledge by reading
and observation, and educate it to the creation
of thoughts by cultivating a habit of
reflection. There is no limit to the knowledge
that will be desirable and useful; it
should include something of natural science,
much of history, and still more of human
nature. The latter must be your study, for
it is with this that the writer and speaker
has to deal.</p>

<p>Remember, that no amount of antiquarian,
or historical, or scientific, or literary lore
will make a writer or orator, without intimate
acquaintance with the ways of the
world about him, with the tastes, sentiments,
passions, emotions, and modes of thought of
the men and women of the age in which he
lives, and whose minds it is his business to
instruct and sway.</p>

<h3>HOW TO ACQUIRE A CAPTIVATING STYLE.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-y.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">You must think, that you may have
thoughts to convey; and read, that
you may have words wherewith to express
your thoughts correctly and gracefully.
But something more than this is required to
qualify you to write or speak. You must
have a <i>style</i>. I will endeavor to explain
what I mean by that.</p>

<p>As every man has a manner of his own,
differing from the manner of every other
man, so has every mind its own fashion of
communicating with other minds. This
manner of expressing thought is <i>style</i>, and
therefore may style be described as the features
of the mind displayed in its communications
with other minds; as manner is the
external feature exhibited in personal communication.</p>

<p>But though style is the gift of nature, it is
nevertheless to be cultivated; only in a sense
different from that commonly understood by
the word cultivation.</p>

<p>Many elaborate treatises have been written
on style, and the subject usually occupies a
prominent place in all books on composition
and oratory. It is usual with teachers to
urge emphatically the importance of cultivating
style, and to prescribe ingenious recipes
for its production. All these proceed
upon the assumption that style is something
artificial, capable of being taught, and which
may and should be learned by the student,
like spelling or grammar.</p>

<p>But, if the definition of style which I have
submitted to you is right, these elaborate
trainings are a needless labor; probably a
positive mischief. I do not design to say
<i>a</i> style may not be taught to you; but it will
be the style of some other man, and not your
own; and, not being your own, it will no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
more fit your mind than a second-hand suit
of clothes, bought without measurement at a
pawn-shop, would fit your body, and your
appearance in it would be as ungainly.</p>

<p>But you must not gather from this that
you are not to concern yourself about style,
that it may be left to take care of itself, and
that you will require only to write or speak
as untrained nature prompts. I say that you
must cultivate style; but I say also that the
style to be cultivated must be your own, and
not the style of another.</p>

<h4>How to Cultivate Style.</h4>

<p>The majority of those who have written
upon the subject recommend you to study
the styles of the great writers of the English
language, with a view to acquiring their accomplishment.
So I say—study them, by
all means; but not for the purpose of imitation,
not with a view to acquire <i>their</i> manner,
but to learn their language, to see how they
have embodied their thoughts in words, to
discover the manifold graces with which
they have invested the expression of their
thoughts, so as to surround the act of communicating
information, or kindling emotion,
with the various attractions and charms of art.</p>

<p><i>Cultivate style</i>; but instead of laboring to
acquire the style of your model, it should be
your most constant endeavor to avoid it.
The greatest danger to which you are exposed
is that of falling into an imitation
of the manner of some favorite author,
whom you have studied for the sake of
learning a style, which, if you did learn it,
would be unbecoming to you, because it is
not your own. That which in him was <i>manner</i>
becomes in you <i>mannerism</i>; you but
dress yourself in his clothes, and imagine
that you are like him, while you are no more
like than is the valet to his master whose
cast-off coat he is wearing.</p>

<p>There are some authors whose manner is
so infectious that it is extremely difficult <i>not</i>
to catch it. Hawthorne is one of these; it
requires an effort not to fall into his formula
of speech. But your protection against this
danger must be an ever-present conviction
that your own style will be the best for you,
be it ever so bad or good. You must strive
to <i>be</i> yourself, to think for yourself, to speak
in your own manner; then, what you say
and your <i>style</i> of saying it will be in perfect
accord, and the pleasure to those who read
or listen will not be disturbed by a sense of
impropriety and unfitness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I repeat, you should cultivate
your own style, not by changing it into
some other person’s style, but by striving to
preserve its individuality, while decorating it
with all the graces of art. Nature gives the
style, for your style is yourself; but the decorations
are slowly and laboriously acquired
by diligent study, and, above all, by long and
patient practice. There are but two methods
of attaining to this accomplishment—contemplation
of the best productions of art, and
continuous toil in the exercise of it.</p>

<h4>Make Your Composition Attractive.</h4>

<p>I assume that, by the process I have already
described, you have acquired a tolerably
quick flow of ideas, a ready command
of words, and ability to construct grammatical
sentences; all that now remains to you is to
learn to use this knowledge that the result
may be presented in the most attractive
shape to those whom you address. I am
unable to give you many practical hints
towards this, because it is not a thing to be
acquired by formal rules, in a few lessons and
by a set course of study; it is the product of
very wide and long-continued gleanings from
a countless variety of sources; but, above all,
it is taught by experience.</p>

<p>If you compare your compositions at intervals
of six months, you will see the progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
you have made. You began with a multitude
of words, with big nouns and bigger
adjectives, a perfect firework of epithets, a
tendency to call everything by something
else than its proper name, and the more you
admired your own ingenuity the more you
thought it must be admired by others. If
you had a good idea, you were pretty sure
to dilute it by expansion, supposing the
while that you were improving by amplifying
it. You indulged in small flights of
poetry (in prose), not always in appropriate
places, and you were tolerably sure to go off
into rhapsody, and to mistake fine words for
eloquence. This is the juvenile style; and
is not peculiar to yourself—it is the common
fault of <i>all</i> young writers.</p>

<p>But the cure for it may be hastened by
judicious self-treatment. In addition to the
study of good authors, to cultivate your
taste, you may mend your style by a process
of pruning, after the following fashion.
Having finished your composition, or a section
of it, lay it aside, and do not look at it
again for a week, during which interval other
labors will have engaged your thoughts.
You will then be in a condition to revise it
with an approach to critical impartiality,
and so you will begin to learn the wholesome
<i>art of blotting</i>. Go through it slowly,
pen in hand, weighing every word, and asking
yourself, “What did I <i>intend</i> to say?
How can I say it in the briefest and plainest
English?”</p>

<p>Compare with the plain answer you return
to this question the form in which you had
tried to express the same meaning in the
writing before you, and at each word further
ask yourself, “Does this word precisely convey
my thought? Is it the aptest word?
Is it a necessary word? Would my meaning
be fully expressed without it?” If it is
not the best, change it for a better. If it is
superfluous, ruthlessly strike it out.</p>

<p>The work will be painful at first—you will
sacrifice with a sigh so many flourishes of
fancy, so many figures of speech, of whose
birth you were proud. Nay, at the beginning,
and for a long time afterwards, your
courage will fail you, and many a cherished
phrase will be spared by your relenting pen.
But be persistent, and you will triumph at
last. Be not content with one act of erasure.
Read the manuscript again, and, seeing how
much it is improved, you will be inclined to
blot a little more. Lay it aside for a month,
and then read again, and blot again as before.
Be severe toward yourself.</p>

<h3>THE CHOICE OF LANGUAGE.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Simplicity is the crowning
achievement of judgment and
good taste. It is of very slow
growth in the greatest minds; by
the multitude it is never acquired. The
gradual progress towards it can be curiously
traced in the works of the great masters of
English composition, wheresoever the injudicious
zeal of admirers has given to the
world the juvenile writings which their own
better taste had suffered to pass into oblivion.
Lord Macaulay was an instance of this.
Compare his latest with his earliest compositions,
as collected in the posthumous volume
of his “Remains,” and the growth of improvement
will be manifest.</p>

<p>Yet, at first thought, nothing appears to
be easier to remember, and to act upon, than
the rule, “Say what you want to say in the
fewest words that will express your meaning
clearly; and let those words be the plainest,
the most common (not vulgar), and the most
intelligible to the greatest number of persons.”
It is certain that a beginner will adopt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the very reverse of this. He will say what
he has to say in the greatest number of words
he can devise, and those words will be the
most artificial and uncommon his memory
can recall. As he advances, he will learn to
drop these long phrases and big words; he
will gradually contract his language to the
limit of his thoughts, and he will discover,
after long experience, that he was never so
feeble as when he flattered himself that he
was most forcible.</p>

<h4>Faults in Writing.</h4>

<p>I have dwelt upon this subject with repetitions
that may be deemed almost wearisome,
because affectations and conceits are the besetting
sin of modern composition, and the vice
is growing and spreading. The literature of
our periodicals teems with it; the magazines
are infected by it almost as much as the
newspapers, which have been always famous
for it.</p>

<p>Instead of an endeavor to write plainly,
the express purpose of the writers in the
periodicals is to write as obscurely as possible;
they make it a rule never to call anything
by its proper name, never to say anything
directly in plain English, never to
express their true meaning. They delight
to say something quite different in appearance
from that which they purpose to say,
requiring the reader to translate it, if he can,
and, if he cannot, leaving him in a state of
bewilderment, or wholly uninformed.</p>

<p>Worse models you could not find than
those presented to you by the newspapers
and periodicals; yet are you so beset by
them that it is extremely difficult not to
catch the infection. Reading day by day
compositions teeming with bad taste, and
especially where the style floods you with its
conceits and affectations, you unconsciously
fall into the same vile habit, and incessant
vigilance is required to restore you to sound,
vigorous, manly, and wholesome English.
I cannot recommend to you a better plan
for counteracting the inevitable mischief than
the daily reading of portions of some of our
best writers of English, specimens of which
you will find near the close of the First Part
of this volume. We learn more by example
than in any other way, and a careful perusal
of these choice specimens of writing from
the works of the most celebrated authors
will greatly aid you.</p>

<p>You will soon learn to appreciate the power
and beauty of those simple sentences compared
with the forcible feebleness of some,
and the spasmodic efforts and mountebank
contortions of others, that meet your eye
when you turn over the pages of magazine
or newspaper. I do not say that you will at
once become reconciled to plain English,
after being accustomed to the tinsel and tin
trumpets of too many modern writers; but
you will gradually come to like it more and
more; you will return to it with greater zest
year by year; and, having thoroughly learned
to love it, you will strive to follow the example
of the authors who have written it.</p>

<h4>Read Great Authors.</h4>

<p>And this practice of daily reading the
writings of one of the great masters of the
English tongue should never be abandoned.
So long as you have occasion to write or
speak, let it be held by you almost as a duty.
And here I would suggest that you should
read them <i>aloud</i>; for there is no doubt that
the words, entering at once by the eye and
the ear, are more sharply impressed upon
the mind than when perused silently.</p>

<p>Moreover, when reading aloud you read
more slowly; the full meaning of each word
must be understood, that you may give the
right expression to it, and the ear catches the
general structure of the sentences more perfectly.
Nor will this occupy much time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
There is no need to devote to it more than a
few minutes every day. Two or three pages
thus read daily will suffice to preserve the
purity of your taste.</p>

<p>Your first care in composition will be, of
course, to express yourself grammatically.
This is partly habit, partly teaching. If
those with whom a child is brought up talk
grammatically, he will do likewise, from mere
imitation; but he will learn quite as readily
anything ungrammatical to which his ears
may be accustomed; and, as the most fortunate
of us mingle in childhood with servants
and other persons not always observant of
number, gender, mood, and tense, and as even
they who have enjoyed the best education
lapse, in familiar talk, into occasional defiance
of grammar, which could not be avoided
without pedantry, you will find the study of
grammar necessary to you under any circumstances.
Your ear will teach you a great deal,
and you may usually trust to it as a guide;
but sometimes occasions arise when you are
puzzled to determine which is the correct
form of expression, and in such cases there
is safety only in reference to the rule.</p>

<p>Fortunately our public schools and academies
give much attention to the study of
grammar. The very first evidence that a
person is well educated is the ability to speak
correctly. If you were to say, “I paid big
prices for them pictures,” or, “Her photographs
always flatters her,” or, “His fund of
jokes and stories make him a pleasant companion,”
or, “He buys the paper for you and
I”—if you were guilty of committing such
gross errors against good grammar, or scores
of others that might be mentioned, your
chances for obtaining a standing in polite
society would be very slim. Educated persons
would at once rank you as an ignorant
boor, and their treatment of you would be
suggestive of weather below zero. Do not
“murder the King’s English.”</p>

<h3>PUTTING WORDS INTO SENTENCES.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="130" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Having pointed out the importance
of correct grammar and the right
choice of language, I wish now
to furnish you with some practical
suggestions for the construction of sentences.
Remember that a good thought
often suffers from a weak and faulty expression
of it.</p>

<p>Your sentences will certainly shape themselves
after the structure of your own mind.
If your thoughts are vivid and definite, so
will be your language; if dreamy and hazy,
so will your composition be obscure. Your
speech, whether oral or written, can be but
the expression of yourself; and what you are,
that speech will be.</p>

<p>Remember, then, that you cannot materially
change the substantial character of
your writing; but you may much improve
the form of it by the observance of two or
three general rules.</p>

<p>In the first place, <i>be sure you have something
to say</i>. This may appear to you a very unnecessary
precaution; for who, you will ask,
having nothing to say, desires to write or
to speak? I do not doubt that you have
often felt as if your brain was teeming with
thoughts too big for words; but when you
came to seize them, for the purpose of putting
them into words, you have found them
evading your grasp and melting into the air.
They were not <i>thoughts</i> at all, but <i>fancies</i>—shadows
which you had mistaken for substances,
and whose vagueness you would
never have detected, had you not sought to
embody them in language. Hence you will
need to be assured that you have thoughts
to express, before you try to express them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>And how to do this? By asking yourself,
when you take up the pen, what it is you intend
to say, and answering yourself as you
best can, without caring for the form of expression.
If it is only a vague and mystical
idea, conceived in cloudland, you will try in
vain to put it into any form of words, however
rude. If, however, it is a definite
thought, proceed at once to set it down in
words and fix it upon paper.</p>

<h4>Vague and Hazy Ideas.</h4>

<p>The expression of a precise and definite
thought is not difficult. Words will follow
the thought; indeed, they usually accompany
it, because it is almost impossible to
think unless the thought is clothed in words.
So closely are ideas and language linked by
habit, that very few minds are capable of contemplating
them apart, insomuch that it may
be safely asserted of all intellects, save the
highest, that if they are unable to express
their ideas, it is because the ideas are incapable
of expression—because they are vague
and hazy.</p>

<p>For the present purpose it will suffice that
you put upon paper the substance of what
you desire to say, in terms as rude as you
please, the object being simply to measure
your thoughts. If you cannot express them,
do not attribute your failure to the weakness
of language, but to the dreaminess of your
ideas, and therefore banish them without
mercy, and direct your mind to some more
definite object for its contemplations. If you
succeed in putting your ideas into words, be
they ever so rude, you will have learned the
first, the most difficult, and the most important
lesson in the art of writing.</p>

<p>The second is far easier. Having thoughts,
and having embodied those thoughts in unpolished
phrase, your next task will be to
present them in the most attractive form. To
secure the attention of those to whom you
desire to communicate your thoughts, it is
not enough that you utter them in any words
that come uppermost; you must express
them in the best words, and in the most
graceful sentences, so that they may be read
with pleasure, or at least without offending
the taste.</p>

<p>Your first care in the choice of words will
be that they shall express precisely your
meaning. Words are used so loosely in society
that the same word will often be found
to convey half a dozen different ideas to as
many auditors. Even where there is not a
conflict of meanings in the same word, there
is usually a choice of words having meanings
sufficiently alike to be used indiscriminately,
without subjecting the user to a charge of
positive error. But the cultivated taste is
shown in the selection of such as express the
most delicate shades of difference.</p>

<h4>Suit the Word to the Thought.</h4>

<p>Therefore, it is not enough to have abundance
of words; you must learn the precise
meaning of each word, and in what it differs
from other words supposed to be synonymous;
and then you must select that which
most exactly conveys the thought you are
seeking to embody. There is but one way
to fill your mind with words, and that is, to
read the best authors, and to acquire an
accurate knowledge of the precise meaning
of their words—by <i>parsing</i> as you read.</p>

<p>By the practice of <i>parsing</i>, I intend very
nearly the process so called at schools, only
limiting the exercise to the definitions of the
principal words. As thus: take, for instance
the sentence that immediately precedes this,—ask
yourself what is the meaning of “practice,”
of “parsing,” of “process,” and such
like. Write the answer to each, that you
may be assured that your definition is distinct.
Compare it with the definitions of the
same word in the dictionaries, and observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the various senses in which it has been
used.</p>

<p>You will thus learn also the words that
have the same, or nearly the same, meaning—a
large vocabulary of which is necessary
to composition, for frequent repetition of the
same word, especially in the same sentence,
is an inelegance, if not a positive error.
Compare your definition with that of the
authorities, and your use of the word with
the uses of it cited in the dictionary, and you
will thus measure your own progress in the
science of words.</p>

<h4>An Amusing Exercise.</h4>

<p>This useful exercise may be made extremely
amusing as well as instructive, if
friends, having a like desire for self-improvement,
will join you in the practice of it; and
I can assure you that an evening will be thus
spent pleasantly as well as profitably. You
may make a merry game of it—a game of
speculation. Given a word; each one of the
company in turn writes his definition of it;
Webster’s Dictionary, or some other, is then
referred to, and that which comes nearest
the authentic definition wins the honor or
the prize; it may be a sweepstakes carried
off by him whose definition hits the mark
the most nearly.</p>

<p>But, whether in company or alone, you
should not omit the frequent practice of this
exercise, for none will impart such a power
of accurate expression and supply such an
abundance of apt words wherein to embody
the delicate hues and various shadings of
thought.</p>

<p>So with <i>sentences</i>, or the combination of
words. Much skill is required for their construction.
They must convey your meaning
accurately, and as far as possible in the natural
order of thought, and yet they must not
be complex, involved, verbose, stiff, ungainly,
or full of repetitions. They must be brief,
but not curt; explicit, but not verbose.
Here, again, good taste must be your guide,
rather than rules which teachers propound,
but which the pupil never follows.</p>

<p>Not only does every style require its own
construction of a sentence, but almost every
combination of thought will demand a different
shape in the sentence by which it is conveyed.
A standard sentence, like a standard
style, is a pedantic absurdity; and, if you
would avoid it, you must <i>not</i> try to write by
rule, though you may refer to rules in order
to find out your faults after you have written.</p>

<p>Lastly, inasmuch as your design is, not
only to influence, but to please, it will be necessary
for you to cultivate what may be
termed the <i>graces</i> of composition. It is not
enough that you instruct the minds of your
readers; you must gratify their taste, and win
their attention, giving pleasure in the very
process of imparting information. Hence
you must make choice of words that convey
no coarse meanings, and excite no disagreeable
associations. You are not to sacrifice
expression to elegance; but so, likewise, you
are not to be content with a word or a sentence
if it is offensive or unpleasing, merely
because it best expresses your meaning.</p>

<h4>Graces of Composition.</h4>

<p>The precise boundary between refinement
and rudeness cannot be defined; your own
cultivated taste must tell you the point at
which power or explicitness is to be preferred
to delicacy. One more caution I
would impress upon you, that you pause
and give careful consideration to it before
you permit a coarse expression, on account
of its correctness, to pass your critical review
when you revise your manuscript, and again
when you read the proof, if ever you rush
into print.</p>

<p>And much might be said also about the
<i>music of speech</i>. Your words and sentences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
must be musical. They must not come
harshly from the tongue, if uttered, or grate
upon the ear, if heard. There is a rhythm
in words which should be observed in all
composition, written or oral. The perception
of it is a natural gift, but it may be
much cultivated and improved by reading
the works of the great masters of English,
especially of the best poets—the most excellent
of all in this wonderful melody of words
being Longfellow and Tennyson. Perusal
of their works will show you what you
should strive to attain in this respect, even
though it may not enable you fully to accomplish
the object of your endeavor. Aim
at the sun and you will shoot high.</p>

<h3>ERRORS TO BE AVOIDED.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The faculty for writing varies in various
persons. Some write easily, some
laboriously; words flow from some
pens without effort, others produce them slowly;
composition seems to come naturally to
a few, and a few never can learn it, toil after
it as they may. But whatever the natural
power, of this be certain, that <i>good</i> writing
cannot be accomplished without study and
painstaking practice. Facility is far from
being a proof of excellence. Many of the
finest works in our language were written
slowly and painfully; the words changed
again and again, and the structure of the
sentences carefully cast and recast.</p>

<p>There is a fatal facility that runs “in one
weak, washy, everlasting flood,” that is more
hopeless than any slowness or slovenliness.
If you find your pen galloping over the
paper, take it as a warning of a fault to be
shunned; stay your hand, pause, reflect, read
what you have written; see what are the
thoughts you have set down, and resolutely
try to condense them. There is no more
wearisome process than to write the same
thing over again; nevertheless it is a most
efficient teaching. Your endeavor should
be to say the same things, but to say them
in a different form; to condense your
thoughts, and express them in fewer words.</p>

<p>Compare this second effort with the first,
and you will at once measure your improvement.
You cannot now do better than repeat
this lesson twice; rewrite, still bearing
steadily in mind your object, which is, to
say what you desire to utter in words the
most apt and in the briefest form consistent
with intelligibility and grace. Having done
this, take your last copy and strike out pitilessly
every superfluous word, substitute a
vigorous or expressive word for a weak one,
sacrifice the adjectives without remorse, and,
when this work is done, rewrite the whole,
as amended.</p>

<p>And, if you would see what you have
gained by this laborious but effective process,
compare the completed essay with the
first draft of it, and you will recognize the
superiority of careful composition over facile
scribbling. You will be fortunate if you
thus acquire a mastery of condensation, and
can succeed in putting the reins upon that
fatal facility of words, before it has grown
into an unconquerable habit.</p>

<p>Simplicity is the charm of writing, as of
speech; therefore, cultivate it with care. It
is not the natural manner of expression, or,
at least, there grows with great rapidity in
all of us a tendency to an ornamental style
of talking and writing. As soon as the child
emerges from the imperfect phraseology of
his first letters to papa, he sets himself earnestly
to the task of trying to disguise what
he has to say in some other words than such
as plainly express his meaning and nothing
more. To him it seems an object of ambition—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
feat to be proud of—to go by the
most indirect paths, instead of the straight
way, and it is a triumph to give the person
he addresses the task of interpreting his
language, to find the true meaning lying
under the apparent meaning.</p>

<h4>Come Right to the Point.</h4>

<p>Circumlocution is not the invention of refinement
and civilization, but the vice of the
uncultivated; it prevails the most with the
young in years and in minds that never
attain maturity. It is a characteristic of the
savage. You cannot too much school yourself
to avoid this tendency, if it has not
already seized you, as is most probable, or to
banish it, if infected by it.</p>

<p>If you have any doubt of your condition
in this respect, your better course will be to
consult some judicious friend, conscious of
the evil and competent to criticism. Submit
to him some of your compositions, asking
him to tell you candidly what are their
faults, and especially what are the circumlocutions
in them, and how the same thought
might have been better, because more simply
and plainly, expressed. Having studied his
corrections, rewrite the article, striving to
avoid those faults.</p>

<p>Submit this again to your friendly censor,
and, if many faults are found still to linger,
apply yourself to the labor of repetition once
more. Repeat this process with new writings,
until you produce them in a shape that
requires few blottings, and, having thus
learned what to shun, you may venture on
self-reliance.</p>

<p>But, even when parted from your friendly
critic, you should continue to be your own
critic, revising every sentence, with resolute
purpose to strike out all superfluous words
and to substitute an expressive word for
every fine word. You will hesitate to blot
many a pet phrase, of whose invention you
felt proud at the moment of its birth; but,
if it is circumlocution, pass the pen through
it ruthlessly, and by degrees you will train
yourself to the crowning victory of art—simplicity.</p>

<p>When you are writing on any subject,
address yourself to it directly. Come to
the point as speedily as possible, and do not
walk round about it, as if you were reluctant
to grapple with it. There is so much to be
read nowadays that it is the duty of all who
write to condense their thoughts and words.
This cannot always be done in speaking,
where slow minds must follow your faster
lips, but it is always practicable in writing,
where the reader may move slowly, or repeat
what he has not understood on the first
passing of the eye over the words.</p>

<h4>Arranging Your Words.</h4>

<p>In constructing your sentences, marshal
your words in the order of thought—that is
the natural, and therefore the most intelligible
shape for language to assume. In conversation
we do this instinctively, but in writing
the rule is almost always set at defiance.
The man who would tell you a story in a
plain, straightforward way would not write it
without falling into utter confusion and
placing almost every word precisely where
it ought not to be. In learning to write, let
this be your next care.</p>

<p>Probably it will demand much toil at first
in rewriting for the sake of redistributing
your words; acquired habit of long standing
will unconsciously mould your sentences to
the accustomed shape; but persevere and
you will certainly succeed at last, and your
words will express your thoughts precisely
as you think them, and as you desire that
they should be impressed upon the minds of
those to whom they are addressed.</p>

<p>So with the sentences. Let each be complete
in itself, embodying one proposition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Shun that tangled skein in which some
writers involve themselves, to the perplexity
of their readers and their own manifest bewilderment.
When you find a sentence falling
into such a maze, halt and retrace your
steps. Cancel what you have done, and reflect
what you design to say. Set clearly
before your mind the ideas that you had begun
to mingle; disentangle them, range them
in orderly array, and express them in distinct
sentences, where each will stand separate,
but in its right relationship to all the rest.</p>

<p>This exercise will improve, not only your
skill in the art of writing, but also in the art
of thinking, for those involved sentences are
almost always the result of confused thoughts;
the resolve to write clearly will compel you
to think clearly, and you will be surprised
to discover how often thoughts, which had
appeared to you definite in contemplation,
are found, when you come to set them
upon paper, to be most incomplete and
shadowy. Knowing the fault, you can then
put your wits to work and furnish the remedy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Add Adjuncts to each Predicate in Exercises
8, 9, 10 and 11.</i></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Verbs of Incomplete Predication.</span></h5>

<p>Some Verbs do not convey a complete
idea, and therefore cannot be Predicates by
themselves. Such Verbs are called <b>Verbs
of Incomplete Predication</b>, and the words
added to complete the Predicate are called
the <b>Complement</b>.</p>

<h5><i>Examples of Verbs of Incomplete Predication.</i></h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The words, “London is,” do not contain a complete
idea. Add the words, “a great city,” and you
have a complete sentence. “William was,” needs a
complement, and you can finish the sentence by
writing, “Duke of Normandy.”</p>

<h4>SENTENCES COMBINED.</h4>

<p>A number of simple sentences may sometimes
be combined so as to form one.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Example</span>:—The girl was little. She lost her doll.
The doll was pretty. It was new. She lost it yesterday.
She lost it in the afternoon.</p>

<p>These sentences may be combined in one, thus:—The
little girl lost her pretty new doll yesterday
afternoon.</p>

</div>

<p>The combined sentence tells us as much
as the separate sentences, and tells it in a
shorter, clearer, and more pleasing way.</p>

<h6>Exercise 20.</h6>

<p class="center"><i>Combine the following sets of sentences</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The man is tall. He struck his head. He was
entering a carriage. The carriage was low.</p>

</div>

<p>Sentences are often combined by means of
Conjunctions or other connecting words.</p>

<p>Sentences are combined, by means of the
Conjunction <i>and</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Examples</span>:—1. The boy is good. The boy is
clever.</p>

<p>2. William is going to school. John is going to
school.</p>

<p>3. I admire my teacher. I love my teacher.</p>

<p>These may be combined into single sentences,
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The boy is good and clever.</p>

<p>2. William and John are going to school.</p>

<p>3. I admire and love my teacher.</p>

<h4>PUNCTUATION.</h4>

<p>If the proper stops are left out, the meaning
of a sentence may be doubtful. Take,
for example, the toast at a public dinner:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Woman without her man is a brute.</p>

<p>This might mean that woman without man is a
brute. Punctuate the sentence correctly by the right
use of the comma, and you will see that the meaning
is quite different. Thus: Woman, without her, man
is a brute.</p>

</div>

<p>The misplacing of the stops may make
nonsense of a sentence. Take the sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Cæsar entered, on his head his helmet, on his feet
sandals, in his hand his trusty sword, in his eye an
angry glare.</p>

<p>This may become: Cæsar entered on his head,
his helmet on his feet, sandals in his hand, his
trusty sword in his eye, an angry glare.</p>

<p>The barber’s sign also had two meanings according
to its punctuation:</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Note of Interrogation.</span></h5>

<p>Every direct question is followed by a
<b>Note of Interrogation</b>; as, “How do you
do?” “When did you see your father?”
“I suppose, sir, you are a doctor?”</p>

<p>Sometimes a question forms part of a larger
sentence, as,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They put this question to the committee, “Will
you grant us a hearing?” in a manner that proved
their earnestness.</p>

</div>

<p>Except in such cases, a note of interrogation
is always followed by a capital letter.</p>

<p><i>Carefully observe the full stops and notes of
interrogation in the following</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

“Certainly.” “Well, what will happen to you?”
“Nothing.” “You are sure of it?” “Yes.” “Why?”

<h5><span class="smcap">The Comma.</span></h5>

<p>The <b>Comma</b> is the most frequently used
of all stops.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it may be stated that
when, in reading, a slight pause is made, a
comma should be inserted in writing; thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Spaniards were no match for the Roosevelt
fighters, however, and, as had been the case at
La Quasina, the Western cowboys and Eastern
“dandies” hammered the enemy from their path.
Straight ahead they advanced, until by noon they
were well along toward San Juan, the capture of which
was their immediate object. Fighting like demons,
they held their ground tenaciously, now pressing forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
a few feet, then falling back, under the enemy’s
fire, to the position they held a few moments before.</p>

<p>Without books God is silent, justice dormant,
natural science at a stand, philosophy lame, letters
dumb and all things involved in Cimmerian darkness.</p>

<p>When a Noun or Pronoun in Apposition
is very closely connected with the preceding
word, no comma is needed, as,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>My cousin Fred.</p>

<p>Cromwell the Protector.</p>

</div>

<p>When the connection is not so close, or
when the words in apposition are qualified,
the phrase should have commas before and
after, as,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>William, the Norman conqueror of England, lived
a stormy life.</p>

<p>My cousin, the bold and gallant Fred, fell in battle.</p>

any qualifying words joined to it, the whole

marks where they belong. Take time
for this and do it thoroughly.</p>

carrying out your instructions. The sentences
are first printed without punctuation.
I then construct the sentences and give them
punctuation marks:</p>

and pianists.</p>

<p>It is so with learning to express your
thoughts in writing. What is hard at first
becomes “second nature” afterward. I have
prepared some helpful rules and examples
to aid you.</p>

<p><b>When writing a Story which you have
read or heard, observe the following
directions</b>:—</p>

<p>1. Before beginning to write, think over
the whole story, to make sure that you remember
all the points, and the order in which
they come.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Neglect of this direction may cause you to omit
something or to put something in the wrong place.</p>

</div>

<p>2. Before beginning to write each sentence,
arrange the whole of it in your mind.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If you neglect this direction you may find that the
second part of a sentence goes badly with the first,
or that you cannot finish at all a sentence such as
you have begun. Here is an example:—</p>

<p>I am desired to inform the Board of Aldermen that
Mr. Alderman Gill died last night <i>by order of Mrs.
Gill</i>.</p>

<p>The words printed in italics could not have been
in the mind of the writer when he began, or he would
have placed them after <i>desired</i>, or (better still) he
would have said, “I am desired by Mrs. Gill, etc.”</p>

</div>

<p>3. Make short sentences.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Beware of using <i>and</i> and <i>so</i> too much. Avoid
such a sentence as the following:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a fox and he went into
a vineyard and there he saw many bunches of beautiful
ripe grapes hanging on high and he tried to
reach them and he could not jump high enough and
so he turned to go and said “It does not matter; the
grapes are sour.”</p>

<p>Such a sentence ought to be divided into several;
thus:—</p>

<p>A fox once went into a vineyard. There he saw
many bunches of beautiful ripe grapes hanging on
high. He tried to reach them, but found that he
could not jump high enough. As he turned to go he
said, “It does not matter; the grapes are sour.”</p>

<p>The following sentence has several faults besides
its length:—</p>

<p>He [Swinton] did with a sort of eloquence that
moved the whole House lay out all his own errors
and the ill spirit he was in when he committed the
things that were charged on him with so tender a
sense that he seemed as one indifferent what they
should do with him, and without so much as moving
for mercy or even for a delay he did so effectually
prevail on them that they recommended him to the
king as a fit object of his mercy.—<span class="smcap">Burnet</span>: <i>History
of his Own Time</i>.</p>

<p>It is amended somewhat by division into shorter
sentences, thus:—</p>

<p>With a sort of eloquence that moved the whole
House, he did lay out all his own errors and the ill
spirit that he was in when he committed the things
that were charged on him. He spoke with so tender
a sense that he seemed as one indifferent what they
should do with him. Without so much as moving
for mercy or even for a delay, he did so effectually
prevail on them that they recommended him to the
king as a fit object for mercy.</p>

</div>

<p>4. Use no word of which you do not know
the exact meaning.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Neglect of this rule led some one to write:</p>

<p>At the dedication of the Gettysburg Monument,
President Lincoln gave the <i>ovation</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>5. Do not use long words if you can find
short ones.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The barber who advertised himself as “a first-class
tonsorial artist and facial operator,” meant only that
he could cut hair and shave well.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>6. Arrange the different parts of each sentence
so that they convey the meaning which
you intend.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The following sentence is badly arranged:—</p>

<p>He tells stories which Mountain would be shocked
to hear after dinner.—<i>Thackeray</i>: <i>The Virginians</i>.</p>

<p>Mountain would be shocked to hear them at any
time. To convey the author’s meaning the sentence
should be:—</p>

<p>After dinner he tells stories which Mountain would
be shocked to hear.</p>

</div>

<p>7. When you have written your story, always
read it over, and correct all the mistakes
which you can find.</p>

<h4>SHORT STORIES TO BE READ CAREFULLY, AND THEN
WRITTEN FROM MEMORY.</h4>

<h5><i>The Fox and the Goat.</i></h5>

<p>A fox that had fallen into a well tried in vain to
get out again. By-and-by a goat came to the place
to quench her thirst. Seeing the fox below she asked
if the water was good. “Yes,” answered the cunning
creature, “it is so good that I cannot leave off
drinking.” Thereupon the goat, without a moment’s
thought, jumped in. The fox at once scrambled on
her back and got out. Then, looking down at the
poor fool, he said coolly, “If you had half as much
brains as beard, you would look before you leap.”</p>

<h5><i>The Vain Jackdaw.</i></h5>

<p>A vain jackdaw found some peacocks’ feathers and
stuck them amongst his own. Then he left his old
companions and boldly went amongst the peacocks.
They knew him at once, in spite of his disguise; so
they stripped off his borrowed plumes, pecked him
well, and sent him about his business. He went back
to the daws as if nothing had happened, but they
would not allow him to mix with them. If he was
too good for them before, they were too good for him
now. Thus the silly bird, by trying to appear better
than he was, lost his old friends without making any
new ones.</p>

<h5><i>The Ant and the Grasshopper.</i></h5>

<p>One frosty day a grasshopper, half dead with cold
and hunger, knocked at the door of an ant, and
begged for something to eat. “What were you doing
in the summer?” asked the ant. “Oh, I was singing
all the time.” “Then,” said the ant, “if you could
sing all the summer you may dance all the winter.”</p>

<h5><i>The Wolf and the Lamb.</i></h5>

<p>A wolf, coming to a brook to drink, saw a lamb
standing in the stream, some distance down. He
made up his mind to kill her, and at once set about
finding an excuse. “Villain,” he said, “how dare
you dirty the water which I am drinking?” The
lamb answered meekly, “Sir, it is impossible for me
to dirty the water which you are drinking, because
the stream runs from you to me, not from me to you.”
“Be that as it may,” replied the wolf, “you called me
bad names a year ago.” “Sir,” pleaded the lamb,
“you are mistaken; a year ago I was not born.”
“Then,” said the hungry beast, “if it was not you it
was your father, and that is as bad. It is of no use
trying to argue me out of my supper.” Thereupon
he fell upon the poor creature and ate her up.</p>

<h5><i>What the Bear Said.</i></h5>

<p>As two friends were traveling through a wood, a
bear rushed out upon them. One of the men without
a thought to his companion, climbed up into a
tree, and hid among the branches. The other, knowing
that alone he had no chance, threw himself on
the ground, and pretended to be dead; for he had
heard that bears will not touch a dead body. The
creature came and sniffed him from head to foot, but,
thinking him to be lifeless, went away without harming
him. Then the man in the tree got down, and,
hoping to pass his cowardice off with a joke, he said,
“I noticed that the bear had his mouth very close to
your ear; what did he whisper to you?” “Oh,”
answered the other, “he only told me never to keep
company with those who in time of danger leave
their friends in the lurch.”</p>

<h5><i>Bad Company.</i></h5>

<p>A farmer who had just sown his fields placed a
net to catch the cranes that came to steal his corn.
After some time he went to look at the net, and in it
he found several cranes and one stork. “Oh, sir,
please spare me,” said the stork; “I am not a crane,
I am an innocent stork, kind to my parents, and——”
The farmer would hear no more. “All that may be
very true,” he said, “but it is no business of mine.
I found you amongst thieves, and you must suffer
with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<h5><i>Mercury and the Woodmen.</i></h5>

<p>A woodman was working beside a deep river when
his axe slipped, and fell into the water. As the axe
was his living, he was very sorry to lose it, and sat
on the bank to weep. Mercury, hearing his cries,
appeared to him, and, finding what was the matter,
dived, and brought up a golden axe. “Is this the
one which you lost?” asked the god. “No,” said
the woodman. Then the god dived a second time,
and brought up a silver axe, and asked if that was
the one. The woodman again answered “No.” So
Mercury dived a third time, and then he brought up
the axe which had been lost. “That is mine,” cried
the woodman joyfully. The god gave it to him, and
presented him with the other two as a reward for his
truth and honesty.</p>

<p>One of the woodman’s neighbors, hearing what
had happened, determined to see if he could not
have the same good luck. He went to the bank of
the river, began to fell a tree, purposely let his axe
slip into the water, and then pretended to cry. Mercury
appeared as before, dived, and brought up a
golden axe. The man, in his eagerness to grasp the
prize, forgot to act as his neighbor had done; so
when the god asked, “Is that yours?” he answered
“Yes.” To punish him for his lying and dishonesty,
the god would neither give him the golden axe nor
find his own.</p>

<h5><i>Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Siddons.</i></h5>

<p>Dr. Johnson always spoke scornfully of actors and
actresses, but he treated the famous actress, Mrs.
Siddons, with great politeness. She called on him,
and his servant could not readily find a chair for
her. “You see, madam,” said the doctor, “wherever
you go no seats can be got.”</p>

<h5><i>Clever Children.</i></h5>

<p>An ignorant Englishman once visited Paris. After
his return he was talking to some of his friends about
the wonders he had seen. “I was most surprised,”
he said, “with the cleverness of the children. Boys
and girls of seven or eight spoke French quite as
easily as the children in this country speak English.”</p>

<h5><i>One Good Turn Deserves Another.</i></h5>

<p>A Cambridge student sent to another student to
borrow a book. “I never lend my books out,” was
the answer, “but if the gentleman chooses to come
to my rooms he may use them there.” A few days
after the book owner sent to the other student to
borrow a carpet sweeper. “I never lend my carpet
sweeper,” replied he, “but if the gentleman chooses
to come to my rooms he may use it there.”</p>

<h5><i>Learning Rewarded.</i></h5>

<p>A rich farmer sent his son to a famous university.
The young man was rather foolish, and brought
home more folly than learning. One night, when
there were two fowls for supper, he said, “I can
prove these two fowls to be three.” “Let us hear,”
answered the old man. “This,” said the scholar,
pointing to the first, “is one; this,” pointing to the
second, “is two; and two and one make three.”
“Since you have made it out so well,” replied the
father, “your mother shall have the first fowl, I will
have the second, and you may keep the third for
your great learning.”</p>

<h5><i>Daring a Dutchman.</i></h5>

<p>A Dutch vessel and an English vessel were lying
near each other. One of the Dutch sailors wished to
show his activity, so he ran up the mast, and stood
upon his head on the top of it. One of the English
sailors (who did not like to be beaten by a Dutchman)
also tried to stand upon his head on the top of
the mast. He, however, fell. The rigging broke
his fall and he alighted on the deck unhurt. “There,
you lubber,” he cried, “do that if you dare.”</p>

<h5><i>The Miserly Planter.</i></h5>

<p>A very miserly planter formerly lived in the island
of Jamaica. He often gave his poor slaves too little
food. They complained, and he answered that he
could not help himself, because the provision ships
had been taken by pirates. This lying excuse satisfied
them once, twice, thrice, and again, but in the
end long fasting made them impatient. Then they
went to their master and said to him, “Is it not
strange that the pirates have so often taken the ships
bringing food, but have never taken the ships bringing
pickaxes and hoes?”</p>

<h5><i>A Precious Turnip.</i></h5>

<p>Before Louis the Eleventh became king he used
to visit a peasant whose garden produced excellent
fruit. After his accession, the peasant brought him
as a present a very large turnip which had grown in
his garden. The king, remembering the pleasant
hours that he had spent under the old man’s roof,
gave him a thousand crowns. The lord of the village,
hearing of this, thought that if one who gave a
paltry turnip received so large a reward, one who
gave a really valuable present would receive a still
larger reward. He, therefore, offered a splendid
horse. The king accepted it and, calling for the big
turnip, said, “This cost me a thousand crowns; I
give it to you in return for your horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<h5><i>The Dangers of a Bed.</i></h5>

<p>A carpenter asked a sailor, “Where did your
father die?” The sailor answered, “My father, my
grandfather, and my great-grandfather were all
drowned at sea.” “Then,” said the carpenter, “are
you not afraid of going to sea, lest you should be
drowned too?” Instead of replying, the sailor asked,
“Where did your father die?” “In his bed.” “And
your grandfather?” “In his bed.” “And your
great-grandfather?” “In his bed also.” “Then,”
said the sailor, “why should I be more afraid of
going to sea than you are of going to bed?”</p>

<h5><i>How to treat Enemies.</i></h5>

<p>A Scotch minister had in his parish a man who
sometimes used to get drunk. One day the minister,
reproving him for his bad habit, said, “You love
whisky too much, Donald; you know very well that
it is your worst enemy.” “But,” answered the man
slily, “have you not often told us that we ought to
love our enemies?” “True, Donald, but I never
told you that you ought to swallow them.”</p>

<h5><i>The Secret of Success.</i></h5>

<p>During the long struggle between England and
France, two ignorant old ladies were discussing the
war as they went to church. One said, “Is it not
wonderful that the English always beat the French?”
“Not at all,” answered the other; “don’t you know
that the English always say their prayers before
going into battle?” “But,” replied the first, “can’t
the French say their prayers as well?” “Tut, tut,”
said the second; “poor jabbering bodies, who can
understand them?”</p>

<h5><i>The Preacher for Prisoners.</i></h5>

<p>When David Dewar was a member of the Prison
Board the question of appointing a chaplain for the
jail came up. The favorite candidate of the other
members of the Board was an unsuccessful clergyman.
David, when asked to vote for him, said, “I
have no objection; I hear that he has already
preached a church empty, and if he will only preach
the jail empty too, he is just the man for our money.”</p>

<h5><i>The Squire and his Servant.</i></h5>

<p>A Scotch squire was one day riding out with his
man. Opposite a hole in a steep bank the master
stopped and said, “John, I saw a badger go in
there.” “Did you?” said John; “will you hold
my horse, sir?” “Certainly,” answered the squire,
and away rushed John for a spade. He got one and
dug furiously for half an hour, the squire looking on
with an amused look. At last John exclaimed, “I
can’t find him, sir.” “I should be surprised if you
could,” said the squire, “for it is ten years since I
saw him go in.”</p>

<h5><i>Proper Payment.</i></h5>

<p>A boy went into a baker’s shop and bought a five-cent
loaf. It seemed to him rather small, so he said
that he did not believe it to be of full weight. “Never
mind,” answered the baker, “you will have the less
to carry.” “True,” replied the lad, and throwing
four cents on the counter he left the shop. The baker
called after him, “Hi! this is not enough money.”
“Never mind,” said the boy, “you will have the less
to count.”</p>

<h5><i>The Corporal’s Watch.</i></h5>

<p>A corporal in the life-guards of Frederick the Great
was a brave but rather vain fellow. He could not
afford a watch, but managed to buy a chain, and this
he wore with a bullet at the end. The king, hearing
of this, thought he would have a little fun at the soldier’s
expense, so he said to him, “It is six o’clock by
my watch; what time is it by yours?” The man
drew the bullet from his pocket and answered, “My
watch does not mark the hour, but it tells me every
moment that it is my duty to face death for your
Majesty.” “Here, my friend,” said Frederick, offering
him his own costly watch, “take this, that you
may be able to tell the hour also.”</p>

<h5><i>Three Toasts.</i></h5>

<p>When the Earl of Stair was ambassador in Holland
he was once at a banquet with the French and
Austrian ambassadors. The Frenchman proposed
the health of his master, calling him, “The Sun.”
The Austrian then proposed the health of his mistress,
calling her “The Moon.” The Earl of Stair
was equal to the occasion, for when his turn came he
proposed the health of his sovereign as “Joshua, who
made the sun and moon to stand still.”</p>

<h5><i>Going to Sleep in Church.</i></h5>

<p>A Scotch clergyman had a youth in his congregation
who was underwitted, and was commonly spoken
of as being half daft. One Sunday the clergyman
observed that all his hearers were asleep except this
youth. After the service the minister congratulated
him upon being awake, when he naively replied,
“Maybe if I hadn’t been half daft I would have
been asleep too.”</p>

<h5><i>Striking Back.</i></h5>

<p>A little girl complained to her brother that a boy
had struck her. “Why did you not strike back?”
he asked. “O,” said the innocent creature, “I did
that before he hit me.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">The following is an outline of one of
Æsop’s fables:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Donkey carrying salt—passing through
stream—falls—loses load.</p>

<p>2. Next day loaded with salt—lies down in stream.</p>

<p>3. Master resolves to teach lesson—third journey
load of sponge.</p>

<p>4. Donkey lies down—load heavier.</p>

</div>

<p>This outline may be filled in thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A donkey laden with salt happened to fall while
passing through a stream. <i>The water melted the
salt</i>, and the donkey <i>on getting up was delighted</i> to
find himself with nothing to carry. Next day he had
to pass again, laden with salt, through the same
stream. <i>Remembering how the water had yesterday
rid him of his burden</i>, he lay down purposely, and
was again rid of it. <i>But clever as he was his master
was cleverer</i>, and resolved to teach him a lesson.
On the third journey he therefore placed on the
creature’s back several bags filled with sponges.
The donkey lay down as before, but on getting up
he found that his load, instead of being much lighter,
was much heavier.</p>

</div>

<p>In the fable, as thus told, there are several

of the household, when it was promptly killed by the
peasant.</p>

<p>Here is the same story, told in prose:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One afternoon in a western port, three fishermen
might be seen walking slowly down towards the
beach. Heavy masses of clouds were moving rapidly
overhead; the setting sun had tinged the sky
an angry crimson, and the waves broke with a
moaning noise over the bar at the mouth of the harbor.
The fishermen knew that a storm was threatening,
but still they were going to sea, for their families
were large and their earnings had of late been
small. Yet they were sad at heart, and as they sailed
away they thought of the dear wives left behind, and
of the dear children watching them out of the town.</p>

<p>The women were so anxious that they could not
rest at home, so they went up to the lighthouse to
trim the lamps and peer out into the darkness. The
storm came on even sooner than was expected. A
huge billow caught the fishermen’s boat and sank it,
and the tide carried their dead bodies to the shore.</p>

<p>By morning the storm had passed, and the rising
sun shone on the wet sand and on three poor women
wringing their hands over the corpses of their husbands.</p>

</div>

<p>Note that in this prose rendering there is
no attempt to preserve the poetry. Attention
has been paid to the story only, and that
has been told in the simplest manner. I
here append a cluster of poems to be turned
into prose.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And talon unremittingly assailed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The wreathèd serpent, who did ever seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his enemy’s heart a mortal wound to wreak.—<i>Shelley.</i></div>

<h4>ESSAYS TO BE WRITTEN FROM OUTLINES.</h4>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is considered best by most experienced
writers to prepare a plan of the composition,
of whatever character it may
be. In this way you are able to properly
arrange your thoughts, and are less likely
to omit something which ought to be treated.</p>

<p>There are authors who map out in their
minds a general plan without committing it
formally to paper. The disadvantage of this
method is that something is liable to be
forgotten, or inserted in the wrong place.
Many authors compose a whole book with
nothing more in mind than the general outline:
others draw out what lawyers would
call a “brief,” from which they build up their
production step by step.</p>

<p>To aid you in learning how to write compositions,
I have inserted here the outlines
of essays from which the complete productions
are to be written. Many of these
subjects will compel you to consult books in
order that you may obtain the information
you require, yet this will only be a benefit to
you, and will amply repay all the time and
labor you expend.</p>

<p>You do not need to confine yourself to the
thoughts suggested in these outlines. Think
for yourself; do not always go on crutches.
Introduce new matter and express whatever
is suggested to your mind, that will make
your production complete and interesting.</p>

<p>The following is an outline of a brief and
simple essay on “The Cat.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Where found.</p>

<p>2. Why kept.</p>

<p>3. Fitted to be a beast of prey:—(<i>a</i>) Teeth; (<i>b</i>)
Claws; (<i>c</i>) Pads.</p>

<p>4. Fitted for night prowling:—(<i>a</i>) Fur; (<i>b</i>) Eyes.</p>

<p>5. Fitted to be a pet.</p>

<p>6. Habits.</p>

</div>

<p>The outline may be filled in thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A cat is found in nearly every house. Sometimes
it is kept as a pet only, and sometimes it is kept only
to catch mice, but most people keep one for both
purposes. The cat is fitted by nature to be a beast
of prey; hence its claws and teeth are sharp and long,
and under its feet are pads, which enable it to walk
without making a noise. The cat is also fitted for
prowling at night. Its thick fur keeps it from feeling
cold, and its wonderful eyes enable it to see almost
in the dark. Cats make good pets because they are
pretty, clean and gentle. They like to lie on something
soft and warm. When stroked they purr.
Kittens are very playful.</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">An apt illustration is always a help to a
writer or speaker. The mind of the
reader or hearer is interested in
tracing the comparison, and receives
a stronger impression than it does
when the thought is stated simply by itself.</p>

<p>Many of the most famous orators have
been very gifted in employing similes to express
their meaning. You should cultivate
the habit of using illustrations. Although
there is sometimes danger in employing
them, yet where carefully and rightly used
they not only ornament the composition,
but render its thoughts and ideas more
striking, more impressive and more easily
remembered.</p>

<p><b>A Simile</b> is a comparison explicitly stated;
as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now does he feel his title</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hang loose upon him like a giant’s robe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a dwarfish thief.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How far that little candle throws his beams!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">An evil soul producing holy witness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is like a goodly apple rotten at the heart.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The course of a great statesman resembles that of
navigable rivers, avoiding immovable obstacles with
noble bends of concession, seeking the broad levels
of opinion on which men soonest settle and longest
dwell, following and marking the most imperceptible
slopes of national tendency, yet always aiming at
direct advances, always recruited from sources nearer
heaven, and sometimes bursting open paths of progress
and fruitful human commerce through what
seem the eternal barriers of both.</p>

</div>

<p><b>A Metaphor</b> is a condensed Simile. The
comparison is implied, but not expressed at
length; thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But look, the morn in russet mantle clad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastern hill.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The simile implied here is, “The morning like to
a person clad in russet mantle walks,” etc.</p>

<p>Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with
truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness
... above all taking the shield of faith wherewith
ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of
the wicked.</p>

</div>

<p>Similes and Metaphors are employed</p>

<p>1. To aid the understanding.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We comprehend the unknown best by comparison
with the known.</p>

</div>

<p>2. To intensify the feelings; as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice.</p>

<p>What a piece of work is man; how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving
how express and admirable! in action how like an
angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty
of the world! the paragon of animals!</p>

</div>

<p>3. To give point and force to what we
wish to express.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Our conduct towards the Indians has been that of
a man who subscribes to hospitals, weeps at charity
sermons, carries out broth and blankets to beggars,
and then comes home and beats his wife and children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Howe’er it be, it seems to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Tis only noble to be good.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kind hearts are more than coronets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And simple faith than Norman blood.—<i>Tennyson.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every one must admit the beauty and force of the
great poet’s comparison of kind hearts to coronets,
and simple faith to Norman blood, implying that
each object mentioned surpasses the one with which
it is compared.</p>

</div>

<p>The following rules should be observed in
the conduct of Metaphors:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Do not use metaphors, except when needed to
make a sentence clearer or stronger. Needless metaphors
are a blemish instead of an ornament.</p>

<p>2. Do not pursue a simile or metaphor too far.
The further it is pursued the less likely is the comparison
to hold.</p>

<p>3. Metaphors should avoid mean or disagreeable
details.</p>

<p>4. Metaphors should not be forced. Some metaphors
are so far-fetched that (as Mr. Lowell says) one
could wish their authors no worse fate than to be
obliged to carry them back whence they came.</p>

<p>5. Do not mix literal and metaphorical language.
In the sentence</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I was walking on the barren hills of sin and sorrow near Welshpool,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“the barren hills of sin and sorrow” is metaphorical,
and “near Welshpool” is literal.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Compose and Write Letters.</span></h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">To be a good letter writer is an accomplishment
as desirable as it is rare.
Few persons possess the faculty of
writing an interesting letter, politely and
gracefully expressed. Unless you are an exception
to the general rule you become stiff
and formal when you attempt to express
your thoughts to a friend, or make known
your wants to a man of business. The
epistle is labored, unnatural and lacking in
that ease which is the charm of conversation.</p>

<p>“I now take my pen in hand,” etc. Do
get rid of all old, set forms of expression.
Imagine the person to whom you are writing
as placed right before you, and talk to him
with your pen as you would with your
tongue.</p>

<p>There can be but one opinion concerning the
general value of correspondence. How often
people complain that they do not get letters
from their friends. Neglect can be shown in
no way more effectively than by failing to
answer a letter when it ought to be written.</p>

<p>In writing a letter, care should be taken
that the different parts are properly arranged.</p>

<p>First comes the <b>Address of the Writer</b>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This is written at the top of the paper, towards the
right side. If the address consists of several parts,
each part is given a separate line; thus—</p>

<div class="addressblock">
<div class="lines">
<p><span class="smcap">Livonia,<br />
Livingston Co.,<br />
<span class="line">New York.</span></span></p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>After the address comes the <b>Date of
Writing</b>.</p>

<p>Next comes the <b>Form of Address</b>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This is always placed towards the left of the page,
and varies according to the relations between the
sender and the receiver of the letter. Writing to an
intimate friend, one may say, “My dear Tom,” or (a
little less familiarly) “My dear Brown.” Writing to
a friend who is also a superior in age or position, one
would say, “My dear Mr. Brown.” “Dear Sir” is
formal, but claims some small degree of acquaintance
or regard. “Sir” is purely formal. Similarly
we may have, “My dear Annie,” “My dear Mrs.
Brown,” “Dear Madam,” and “Madam.” In writing
to Miss Jones, a stranger, you may not wish to
say, “Dear Miss.” It would be better in this instance
to address her as “Miss Jones.”</p>

</div>

<p>After the form of address comes the
<b>Letter</b>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A friendly letter should be easy and pleasant in
style—it should be, in fact, a talk on paper. In a
business letter, on the other hand, the style is brief
and concise. The first aim of the writer is to make
himself understood, the next to be brief.</p>

</div>

<p>After the letter comes the <b>Subscription</b>,
as,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="subscriptionblock">
<div class="lines">
<p>Sincerely yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Alexander Argyle</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="subscriptionblock">
<div class="lines">

</div>
</div>

<p>Or in more formal style,</p>

<div class="subscriptionblock">
<div class="lines">
<p>I am, dear sir,<br />
Your obedient servant,<br />
<span class="line"><span class="smcap">Thomas Lancaster</span>.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The subscription is arranged like the address, but
begins further to the left. The form of subscription
varies with the form of address.</p>

</div>

<p>A business letter ends with the <b>Address
of the Person to whom it is Sent</b>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This is written in the left corner. A friendly letter
generally ends with the subscription.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Do not consider yourself too ambitious
when you make an earnest
effort to express your thoughts
so well that your productions will compare
favorably with those of the best writers.
You should have specimens of the best
composition before you. The following
pages contain such, and you will readily see
how the most famous authors construct their
sentences, what apt words they choose, and
how easily, yet forcibly, they express their
ideas.</p>

<p>Do not be disheartened if you fail to come
up to the standard here placed before you. It
is related of the great painter, Correggio,
that he was once almost ready to fling away
his brush, exclaiming, “I can never paint
like Raphael.” But he persevered, and at
length the great painter whom he admired
so much said, “If I were not Raphael, I
would wish to be Correggio.” You should
take the best writers for your models and set
your standard high. Be a severe critic of
yourself, and do your very best.</p>

<h4>GETTING THE RIGHT START.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. G. Holland.</span></p>

<p>In clear expression of thought and use of plain, forcible English, the works of Doctor Holland are superior
to those of most authors. He does not employ large, overgrown words, but such as are easily understood.
This is one secret of the popularity of his writings. Dr. Holland was born at Belchertown, Mass., in 1819,
and died October 12, 1881. He was associate editor of the “Springfield Republican,” and in 1870 became
editor of “Scribner’s Magazine.” Both as a writer of prose and poetry he is held in high esteem by all
lovers of elevated thought and pure diction.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Society demands that a young
man shall be somebody, not only,
but that he shall prove his right to
the title; and it has a right to demand this.
Society will not take this matter upon trust—at
least, not for a long time, for it has
been cheated too frequently. Society is not
very particular what a man does, so that it
proves him to be a man: then it will bow to
him, and make room for him.</p>

<p>I know a young man who made a place
for himself by writing an article for the
North American Review: nobody read the
article, so far as I know, but the fact that he
wrote such an article, that it was very long,
and that it was published, did the business
for him. Everybody, however, cannot write
articles for the North American Review—at
least I hope everybody will not, for it is
a publication which makes me a quarterly
visit; but everybody, who is somebody, can
do something. There is a wide range of effort
between holding a skein of silk for a lady
and saving her from drowning—between collecting
voters on election day and teaching
a Sunday-school class.</p>

<p>A man must enter society of his own free
will, as an active element or a valuable component,
before he can receive the recognition
that every true man longs for. I take it that
this is right. A man who is willing to enter
society as a beneficiary is mean, and does
not deserve recognition.</p>

<p>There is no surer sign of an unmanly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
cowardly spirit than a vague desire for help,
a wish to depend, to lean upon somebody,
and enjoy the fruits of the industry of others.
There are multitudes of young men, I suppose,
who indulge in dreams of help from
some quarter, coming in at a convenient moment,
to enable them to secure the success
in life which they covet.</p>

<p>The vision haunts them of some benevolent
old gentleman with a pocket full of
money, a trunk full of mortgages and stocks,
and a mind remarkably appreciative of merit
and genius, who will, perhaps, give or lend
them anywhere from ten to twenty thousand
dollars, with which they will commence and
go on swimmingly. Perhaps he will take a
different turn, and educate them. Or, perhaps,
with an eye to the sacred profession,
they desire to become the beneficiaries of
some benevolent society, or some gentle circle
of female devotees.</p>

<p>To me, one of the most disgusting sights
in the world is that of a young man with
healthy blood, broad shoulders, presentable
calves, and a hundred and fifty pounds, more
or less, of good bone and muscle, standing
with his hands in his pockets, longing for
help. I admit that there are positions in
which the most independent spirit may accept
of assistance—may, in fact, as a choice
of evils, desire it; but for a man who is able
to help himself, to desire the help of others
in the accomplishment of his plans of life, is
positive proof that he has received a most
unfortunate training, or that there is a leaven
of meanness in his composition that should
make him shudder.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me: I would not
inculcate that pride of personal independence
which repels in its sensitiveness the well-meant
good offices and benefactions of friends,
or that resorts to desperate shifts rather than
incur an obligation. What I condemn in a
young man is the love of dependence; the
willingness to be under obligation for that
which his own efforts may win.</p>

<p>Let this be understood, then, at starting;
that the patient conquest of difficulties which
rise in the regular and legitimate channels of
business and enterprise, is not only essential
in securing the success which you seek, but it
is essential to that preparation of your mind
which is requisite for the enjoyment of your
successes, and for retaining them when
gained. It is the general rule of Providence,
the world over, and in all time, that unearned
success is a curse. It is the rule of Providence,
that the process of earning success
shall be the preparation for its conservation
and enjoyment.</p>

<p>So, day by day, and week by week; so,
month after month, and year after year, work
on, and in that process gain strength and
symmetry, and nerve and knowledge, that
when success, patiently and bravely worked
for, shall come, it may find you prepared to
receive it and keep it.</p>

<p>The development which you will get in
this brave and patient labor, will prove itself,
in the end, the most valuable of your successes.
It will help to make a man of you.
It will give you power and self-reliance. It
will give you not only self-respect, but the
respect of your fellows and the public.</p>

<p>Never allow yourself to be seduced from
this course. You will hear of young men
who have made fortunes in some wild speculations.
Pity them; for they will almost
certainly lose their easily won success. Do
not be in a hurry for anything. Are you in
love with some dear girl, whom you would
make your wife? Give Angelina Matilda to
understand that she must wait; and if Angelina
Matilda is really the good girl you
take her to be, she will be sensible enough
to tell you to choose your time.</p>

<p>You cannot build well without first laying
a good foundation; and for you to enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
upon a business which you have not patiently
and thoroughly learned, and to marry before
you have won a character, or even the reasonable
prospect of a competence, is ultimately
to bring your house down about the
ears of Angelina Matilda, and such pretty
children as she may give you. If, at the age
of thirty years, you find yourself established
in a business which pays you with certainty
a living income, you are to remember that
God has blessed you beyond the majority of
men.</p>

<h4>DINAH THE METHODIST.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By George Eliot.</span></p>

<p>The works of Marian Evans Cross created unusual interest when first
published in England. Her “Adam Bede,” “The Mill on the Floss” and “Silas
Marner,” immediately placed her in the highest rank of the writers of
fiction. For some time her identity was concealed, yet there were critics
who suspected that “George Eliot” was the assumed name of a female
author. Her writings are characterized by a keen insight into character,
intellectual vigor and sympathy with the advanced thought of the day. She
was born in 1819, and died in 1880. The selection from “Adam Bede,” here
given, is an excellent specimen from one of her well-known works.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Several of the men followed Ben’s
lead, and the traveler pushed his
horse on to the Green, as Dinah
walked rather quickly, and in advance of her
companions, toward the cart under the
maple tree. While she was near Seth’s tall
figure she looked short, but when she had
mounted the cart, and was away from all
comparison, she seemed above the middle
height of woman, though in reality she did
not exceed it—an effect which was due to
the slimness of her figure, and the simple
line of her black stuff dress.</p>

<p>The stranger was struck with surprise as
he saw her approach and mount the cart—surprise,
not so much for the feminine delicacy
of her appearance, as at the total absence
of self-consciousness in her demeanor.
He had made up his mind to see her advance
with a measured step, and a demure
solemnity of countenance; he had felt sure
that her face would be mantled with a smile
of conscious saintship, or else charged with
denunciatory bitterness. He knew but two
types of Methodist—the ecstatic and the
bilious.</p>

<p>But Dinah walked as simply as if she were
going to market, and seemed as unconscious
of her outward appearance as a little boy;
there was no blush, no tremulousness, which
said, “I know you think me a pretty woman,
too young to preach;” no casting up or
down of the eyelids, no compression of the
lips, no attitude of the arms, that said, “But
you must think of me as a saint.”</p>

<p>She held no book in her ungloved hands,
but let them hang down lightly crossed before
her, as she stood and turned her grey
eyes on the people. There was no keenness
in her eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding
love than making observations; they
had the liquid look which tells that the mind
is full of what it has to give out, rather than
impressed by external objects.</p>

<p>The eyebrows, of the same color as the
hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly
pencilled; the eyelashes, though no darker,
were long and abundant; nothing was left
blurred or unfinished.</p>

<p>It was one of those faces that make one
think of white flowers with light touches of
color on their pure petals. The eyes had no
peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression;
they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely
loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer,
could help melting away before their glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Joshua Rann gave a long cough, as if he
were clearing his throat in order to come to
a new understanding with himself; Chad
Cranage lifted up his leather skull-cap and
scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered
how Seth had the pluck to think of
courting her.</p>

<p>“A sweet woman,” the stranger said to
himself, “but surely Nature never meant her
for a preacher.”</p>

<h4>GODFREY AND DUNSTAN.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By George Eliot.</span></p>

<p>An excellent example of dialogue in fiction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Some one opened the door at the
other end of the room, and Nancy
felt that it was her husband. She
turned from the window with gladness
in her eyes, for the wife’s chief dread
was stilled.</p>

<p>“Dear, I’m so thankful you’re come,” she
said, going towards him. “I began to get”—</p>

<p>She paused abruptly, for Godfrey was laying
down his hat with trembling hands, and
turned towards her with a pale face and a
strange, unanswering glance, as if he saw her
indeed, but saw her as part of a scene invisible
to herself. She laid her hand on his
arm, not daring to speak again; but he left
the touch unnoticed, and threw himself into
his chair.</p>

<p>Jane was already at the door with the hissing
urn. “Tell her to keep away, will you?”
said Godfrey; and when the door was closed
again he exerted himself to speak more distinctly.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Nancy—there,” he said, pointing
to a chair opposite him. “I came back
as soon as I could to hinder anybody’s telling
you but me. I’ve had a great shock—but
I care most about the shock it’ll be to
you.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t father and Priscilla?” said Nancy,
with quivering lips, clasping her hands together
tightly on her lap.</p>

<p>“No, it’s nobody living,” said Godfrey, unequal
to the considerate skill with which he
would have wished to make his revelation.
“It’s Dunstan—my brother Dunstan, that we
lost sight of sixteen years ago. We’ve found
him,—found his body—his skeleton.”</p>

<p>The deep dread Godfrey’s look had created
in Nancy made her feel these words a relief.
She sat in comparative calmness to hear what
else he had to tell. He went on:</p>

<p>“The stone pit has gone dry suddenly,—from
the draining, I suppose; and there he
lies—has lain for sixteen years, wedged between
two great stones. There’s his watch
and seals, and there’s my gold-handled hunting
whip, with my name on. He took it
away, without my knowing, the day he went
hunting on Wildfire, the last time he was
seen.”</p>

<p>Godfrey paused! it was not so easy to say
what came next. “Do you think he drowned
himself?” said Nancy, almost wondering
that her husband should be so deeply shaken
by what had happened all those years ago to
an unloved brother, of whom worse things
had been augured.</p>

<p>“No, he fell in,” said Godfrey, in a low but
distinct voice, as if he felt some deep meaning
in the fact. Presently he added: “Dunstan
was the man that robbed Silas Marner.”</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Nancy’s face and neck
at this surprise and shame, for she had been
bred up to regard even a distant kinship with
crime as a dishonor.</p>

<p>“O Godfrey!” she said, with compassion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
in her tone, for she had immediately reflected
that the dishonor must be felt more keenly
by her husband.</p>

<p>“There was money in the pit,” he continued,
“all the weaver’s money. Everything’s been
gathered up, and they have taken the skeleton
to the Rainbow. But I came back to tell you.
There was no hindering it; you must know.”</p>

<p>He was silent, looking on the ground for
two long minutes. Nancy would have said
some words of comfort under this disgrace,
but she refrained, from an instinctive sense
that there was something behind,—that Godfrey
had something else to tell her. Presently
he lifted his eyes to her face, and kept
them fixed on her, as he said:</p>

<p>“Everything comes to light, Nancy, sooner
or later. When God Almighty wills it, our
secrets are found out. I’ve lived with a
secret on my mind, but I’ll keep it from you
no longer. I wouldn’t have you know it by
somebody else, and not by me—I wouldn’t
have you find it out after I’m dead. I’ll tell
you now. It’s been ‘I will’ and ‘I won’t’
with me all my life; I’ll make sure of myself
now.”</p>

<p>Nancy’s utmost dread had returned. The
eyes of the husband and wife met with an
awe in them, as at a crisis which suspended
affection.</p>

<p>“Nancy,” said Godfrey slowly, “when I
married you, I hid something from you,—something
I ought to have told you. That
woman Marner found dead in the snow—Eppie’s
mother—that wretched woman—was
my wife; Eppie is my child.”</p>

<p>He paused, dreading the effects of his confession.
But Nancy sat quite still, only that
her eyes dropped and ceased to meet his.
She was pale and quiet as a meditative statue,
clasping her hands on her lap.</p>

<p>“You’ll never think the same of me again,”
said Godfrey after a little while, with some
tremor in his voice. She was silent.</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to have left the child unowned;
I oughtn’t to have kept it from you.
But I couldn’t bear to give you up, Nancy.
I was led away into marrying her; I suffered
for it.”</p>

<p>Still Nancy was silent, looking down; and
he almost expected that she would presently
get up and say she would go to her father’s.
How could she have any mercy for faults
that seemed so black to her, with her simple,
severe notions?</p>

<p>But at last she lifted up her eyes to his
again and spoke. There was no indignation
in her voice; only deep regret.</p>

<p>“Godfrey, if you had told me this six
years ago, we could have done some of our
duty by the child. Do you think I’d have
refused to take her in, if I’d known she was
yours?”</p>

<p>At that moment Godfrey felt all the bitterness
of an error that was not simply futile,
but had defeated its own end. He had not
measured this wife with whom he had lived
so long. But she spoke again, with more
agitation.</p>

<p>“And—oh, Godfrey—if we’d had her from
the first, if you’d taken to her as you ought,
she’d have loved me for her mother—and
you’d been happier with me; I could better
have bore my little baby dying, and our life
might have been more like what we used to
think it ’ud be.”</p>

<p>The tears fell, and Nancy ceased to speak.</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t have married me then,
Nancy, if I’d told you,” said Godfrey, urged,
in the bitterness of his self-reproach, to prove
to himself that his conduct had not been
utter folly. “You may think you would
now, but you wouldn’t then. With your
pride and your father’s, you’d have hated
having anything to do with me after the
talk there’d been.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say what I should have done
about that, Godfrey. I should never have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
married anybody else. But I wasn’t worth
doing wrong for; nothing is in this world.
Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand;
not even our marrying wasn’t, you see.”
There was a faint, sad smile on Nancy’s face
as she said the last words.</p>

<p>“I’m a worse man than you thought I was,
Nancy,” said Godfrey rather tremulously.
“Can you forgive me ever?”</p>

<p>“The wrong to me is but little, Godfrey.
You’ve made it up to me; you’ve been good
to me for fifteen years. It’s another you did
the wrong to; and I doubt it can never be
all made up for.”</p>

<p>“But we can take Eppie now,” said Godfrey.
“I won’t mind the world knowing at
last. I’ll be plain and open for the rest o’
my life.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be different coming to us, now she’s
grown up,” said Nancy, shaking her head
sadly. “But it’s your duty to acknowledge
her and provide for her; and I’ll do my part
by her, and pray to God Almighty to make
her love me.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go together to Silas Marner’s
this very night, as soon as everything’s quiet
at the Stone Pits.”</p>

<h4>RIP VAN WINKLE.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Washington Irving.</span></p>

<p>This charming author, who is a master of pure style, beautiful sentiment
and pleasing humor, has been called the father of American literature.
If this be not strictly true, it is a matter of record that no American
authors before his time achieved any remarkable success. Mr. Irving was
born in 1783, and died in 1859. He was particularly happy in portraying
the quaint character and customs of the old Dutch settlers in our
country. He published a number of volumes, including “The Sketch Book,”
“Tales of a Traveler,” “Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus,” etc.
One of Irving’s best known and most delightful short productions is “Rip
Van Winkle,” from which the following extract is taken. The easy-going,
inoffensive character of Rip is delightfully pictured.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The great error in Rip’s composition
was an insuperable aversion to all
kinds of profitable labor. It could
not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance;
for he would sit on a wet rock,
with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar’s
lance, and fish all day without a murmur,
even though he should not be encouraged
by a single nibble.</p>

<p>He would carry a fowling-piece on his
shoulder for hours together, trudging through
woods and swamps, and up hill and down
dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons.
He would never refuse to assist a neighbor
even in the roughest toil, and was a foremost
man at all country frolics for husking Indian
corn, or building stone fences.</p>

<p>The women of the village, too, used to
employ him to run their errands, and to do
such little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands
would not do for them;—in a word,
Rip was ready to attend to anybody’s business
but his own; but as to doing family
duty and keeping his farm in order, he found
it impossible.</p>

<p>In fact, he declared it was of no use to
work on his farm; it was the most pestilent
little piece of ground in the whole country;
everything about it went wrong, and would
go wrong in spite of him. His fences were
continually falling to pieces; his cow would
either go astray, or get among the cabbages;
weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields
than anywhere else; the rain always made a
point of setting in just as he had some outdoor
work to do; so that, though his patrimonial
estate had dwindled away under his
management, acre by acre, until there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
little more left than a mere patch of Indian
corn, and potatoes, yet it was the worst conditioned
farm in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>His children, too, were as ragged and
wild as if they belonged to nobody. His
son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness,
promised to inherit the habits, with the
old clothes, of his father. He was generally
seen trooping like a colt at his mother’s heels,
equipped in a pair of his father’s cast-off
trousers, which he had much ado to hold up
with one hand, as a fine lady does her train
in bad weather.</p>

<p>Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of
those happy mortals, of foolish, well-oiled
dispositions, who take the world easy, eat
white bread or brown, whichever can be got
with least thought or trouble, and would
rather starve on a penny than work for a
pound. If left to himself, he would have
whistled life away in perfect contentment;
but his wife kept continually dinning in his
ears about his idleness, his carelessness, and
the ruin he was bringing on his family.</p>

<p>Morning, noon and night her tongue was
incessantly going, and everything he said or
did was sure to produce a torrent of household
eloquence. Rip had but one way of
replying to all lectures of the kind, and that
by frequent use had grown into a habit. He
shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast
up his eyes, but said nothing. This, however,
always provoked a fresh volley from
his wife, so that he was fain to draw off his
forces and take to the outside of the house—the
only side which, in truth, belongs to a
henpecked husband.</p>

<p>Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to
despair, and his only alternative to escape
from the labor of the farm, and the clamor
of his wife, was to take gun in hand and
stroll away into the woods. Here he would
sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree,
and share the contents of his wallet with his
dog Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a
fellow-sufferer in persecution.</p>

<p>“Poor Wolf,” he would say, “thy mistress
leads thee a dog’s life of it; but never mind,
my lad, whilst I live thou shalt never want
a friend to stand by thee.” Wolf would wag
his tail, look wistfully in his master’s face,
and if dogs can feel pity, I verily believe
he reciprocated the sentiment with all his
heart.</p>

<h4>THE PURITANS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Lord Macaulay.</span></p>

<p>Distinguished as a descriptive poet by his fine “Lays of Ancient Rome,”
and yet more distinguished as a master of English prose by his “Essays”
and his noble “History of England,” Thomas Babington Macaulay stands
prominent as the most learned and eloquent of the essayists and critics
of the nineteenth century. He was the son of Zachary Macaulay, known as
the warm friend and co-laborer of Wilberforce and Clarkson, and was born
at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, October 25, 1800, and died in 1859. In
1818 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his degree in
1822. Here he gave proof of his great intellectual powers, obtaining a
scholarship, and twice gaining the Chancellor’s medal for a poem called
“Pompeii.” To crown his triumphs, he secured a “Craven Scholarship,”—the
highest distinction in classics which the university confers.</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay’s glowing description of the Puritans has been pronounced
the finest writing of its kind to be found in our language. It is the
product of pre-eminent literary ability, and the highest genius.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">We would first speak of the Puritans
of the sixteenth century, the most
remarkable body of men, perhaps,
which the world has ever produced.</p>

<p>Those who roused the people to resistance—who
directed their measures through
a long series of eventful years—who formed,
out of the most unpromising materials, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
finest army that Europe had ever seen—who
trampled down king, church, and aristocracy—who,
in the short intervals of domestic
sedition and rebellion, made the name of
England terrible to every nation on the face
of the earth—were no vulgar fanatics.</p>

<p>Most of their absurdities were mere external
badges, like the signs of freemasonry or
the dresses of friars. We regret that these
badges were not more attractive; we regret
that a body, to whose courage and talents
mankind has owed inestimable obligations,
had not the lofty elegance which distinguished
some of the adherents of Charles I.,
or the easy good breeding for which the
court of Charles II. was celebrated. But, if
we must make our choice, we shall, like
Bassanio in the play, turn from the specious
caskets which contain only the Death’s head
and the Fool’s head, and fix our choice on
the plain leaden chest which conceals the
treasure.</p>

<p>The Puritans were men whose minds had
derived a peculiar character from the daily
contemplation of superior beings and eternal
interests. Not content with acknowledging,
in general terms, an overruling Providence,
they habitually ascribed every event to the
will of the Great Being, for whose power
nothing was too minute. To know him, to
serve him, to enjoy him, was with them the
great end of existence.</p>

<p>They rejected with contempt the ceremonious
homage which other sects substituted
for the pure worship of the soul. Instead
of catching occasional glimpses of the
Deity through an obscuring veil, they aspired
to gaze full on the intolerable brightness, and
to commune with him face to face. Hence
originated their contempt for terrestrial distinctions.</p>

<p>The difference between the greatest and
meanest of mankind seemed to vanish
when compared with the boundless interval
which separated the whole race from
Him on whom their own eyes were constantly
fixed.</p>

<p>They recognized no title to superiority but
his favor; and, confident of that favor, they
despised all the accomplishments and all the
dignities of the world. If they were unacquainted
with the works of philosophers and
poets, they were deeply read in the oracles
of God; if their names were not found
in the registers of heralds, they felt assured
that they were recorded in the Book of Life;
if their steps were not accompanied by a
splendid train of menials, legions of ministering
angels had charge over them. Their
palaces were houses not made with hands;
their diadems, crowns of glory which should
never fade away.</p>

<p>On the rich and the eloquent, on nobles
and priests, they looked down with contempt;
for they esteemed themselves rich in
a more precious treasure, and eloquent in a
more sublime language—nobles by the right
of an earlier creation, and priests by the imposition
of a mightier hand. The very meanest
of them was a being to whose fate a mysterious
and terrible importance belonged—on
whose slightest actions the spirits of light and
darkness looked with anxious interest—who
had been destined, before heaven and earth
were created, to enjoy a felicity which should
continue when heaven and earth should have
passed away.</p>

<p>Events which short-sighted politicians
ascribed to earthly causes had been ordained
on his account. For his sake empires had
risen and flourished and decayed; for his
sake the Almighty had proclaimed his will
by the pen of the evangelist and the harp of
the prophet. He had been rescued by no
common deliverer from the grasp of no common
foe; he had been ransomed by the
sweat of no vulgar agony, by the blood of no
earthly sacrifice. It was for him that the sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
had been darkened, that the rocks had been
rent, that the dead had arisen, that all nature
had shuddered at the sufferings of her expiring
God!</p>

<h4>ON BEING IN TIME.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By C. H. Spurgeon.</span></p>

<p>When we examine Mr. Spurgeon’s writings we are able to discover one great
secret of his power. As no preacher of modern times was more successful,
in like manner no other had such a vigorous command of plain English
in the pulpit. The great majority of his words are short and simple,
reminding one of the terse writings of the old Puritan authors. Mr.
Spurgeon was born in 1834 and died in 1893. No other writer has published
so many sermons and volumes of miscellaneous writings, and no other
author of similar works has been so widely read. He was the marvel of his
generation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="130" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">He who begins a little late in the morning
will have to drive fast, will be
constantly in a fever, and will
scarcely overtake his business at
night; whereas he who rises in proper time
can enjoy the luxury of pursuing his calling
with regularity, ending his work in fit season,
and gaining a little portion of leisure.</p>

<p>Late in the morning may mean puffing and
blowing all the day long, whereas an early
hour will make the pace an easy one. This
is worth a man’s considering. Much evil
comes of hurry, and hurry is the child of unpunctuality.</p>

<p>We once knew a brother whom we named
“the late Mr. S⸺,” because he never
came in time. A certain tart gentleman,
who had been irritated by this brother’s unpunctuality,
said that the sooner that name
was literally true the better for the temper
of those who had to wait for him. Many a
man would much rather be fined than be
kept waiting. If a man <i>must</i> injure me, let
him rather plunder me of my cash than of
my time.</p>

<p>To keep a busy man waiting is an act of
impudent robbery, and is also a constructive
insult. It may not be so intended, but certainly
if a man has proper respect for his
friend, he will know the value of his time,
and will not cause him to waste it. There
is a cool contempt in unpunctuality, for it as
good as says: “Let the fellow wait; who
is he that I should keep my appointment
with him?”</p>

<p>In this world, matters are so linked together
that you cannot disarrange one without
throwing others out of gear; if one business
is put out of time, another is delayed by the
same means. The other day we were traveling
to the Riviera, and the train after leaving
Paris was detained for an hour and a
half. This was bad enough, but the result
was worse, for when we reached Marseilles
the connecting train had gone, and we were
not only detained for a considerable time,
but were forced to proceed by a slow train,
and so reached our destination six hours
later than we ought to have done. All the
subsequent delay was caused through the
first stoppage.</p>

<p>A merchant once said to us: “A. B. is a
good fellow in many respects, but he is so
frightfully slow that we cannot retain him in
our office, because, as all the clerks work
into each other’s hands, his delays are multiplied
enormously, and cause intolerable inconvenience.
He is a hindrance to the
whole system, and he had better go where
he can work alone.”</p>

<p>The worst of it is that we cannot send unpunctual
people where they can work alone.
To whom or whither should they go? We
cannot rig out a hermitage for each one, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
that would be a great deliverance. If they
prepared their own dinners, it would not
matter that they dropped in after every dish
had become cold. If they preached sermons
to themselves, and had no other audience,
it would not signify that they began
consistently seven minutes behind the published
hour. If they were their own scholars,
and taught themselves, it would be of no
consequence if the pupil sat waiting for his
teacher for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>As it is, we in this world cannot get away
from the unpunctual, nor get them away
from us, and therefore we are obliged to put
up with them; but we should like them to
know that they are a gross nuisance, and a
frequent cause of sin, through irritating the
tempers of those who cannot afford to
squander time as they do.</p>

<p>If this should meet the eye of any gentleman
who has almost forgotten the meaning
of the word “punctuality,” we earnestly
advise him to try and be henceforth five
minutes <i>too soon</i> for every appointment, and
then perhaps he will gradually subside into the
little great virtue which we here recommend.</p>

<p>Could not some good genius get up a
Punctuality Association, every member to
wear a chronometer set to correct time, and
to keep appointments by the minute-hand?
Pledges should be issued, to be signed by
all sluggish persons who can summon up
sufficient resolution totally to abstain from
being behind time in church or chapel, or on
committee, or at dinner, or in coming home
from the office in the evening. Ladies eligible
as members upon signing a special
pledge to keep nobody waiting while they
run upstairs to pop on their bonnets. How
much of sinful temper would be spared, and
how much of time saved, we cannot venture
to guess. Try it.</p>

<h4>JOHN PLOUGHMAN’S TALK ON HOME.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By C. H. Spurgeon.</span></p>

<p>The famous London minister wrote a book entitled, “John Ploughman’s
Talk.” His object was to express plain and homely truths in a quaint,
humorous way, and thus gain the attention of common people whose reading
is confined mostly to murder and divorce cases in newspapers. The
enjoyment of the public in reading Mr. Spurgeon’s pithy sayings was
evinced by the enormous sale of the book. The extract here given is a
fair specimen of its unique style.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">That word <i>home</i> always sounds like
poetry to me. It rings like a peal of
bells at a wedding, only more soft and
sweet, and it chimes deeper into the ears of
my heart. It does not matter whether it
means thatched cottage or manor-house,
home is home, be it ever so homely, and
there’s no place on earth like it. Green grow
the houseleek on the roof forever, and let the
moss flourish on the thatch.</p>

<p>Sweetly the sparrows chirrup and the
swallows twitter around the chosen spot
which is my joy and my rest. Every bird
loves its own nest; the owl thinks the old
ruins the fairest spot under the moon, and
the fox is of opinion that his hole in the hill
is remarkably cozy. When my master’s nag
knows that his head is towards home he
wants no whip, but thinks it best to put on
all steam; and I am always of the same mind,
for the way home, to me, is the best bit of
road in the country. I like to see the smoke
out of my own chimney better than the fire
on another man’s hearth; there’s something
so beautiful in the way in which it curls up
among the trees.</p>

<p>Cold potatoes on my own table taste better
than roast meat at my neighbor’s, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
honeysuckle at my own door is the sweetest
I ever smell. When you are out, friends do
their best, but still it is not home. “Make
yourself at home,” they say, because everybody
knows that to feel at home is to feel at
ease.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“East and west,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Home is best.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Why, at home you are at home, and what
more do you want? Nobody grudges you,
whatever your appetite may be; and you
don’t get put into a damp bed. Safe in his
own castle, like a king in his palace, a man
feels himself somebody, and is not afraid of
being thought proud for thinking so. Every
cock may crow on his own dunghill; and a
dog is a lion when he is at home. No need
to guard every word because some enemy is
on the watch, no keeping the heart under
lock and key; but as soon as the door is
shut it is liberty hall, and none to peep and
pry.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact, and perhaps some of
you will doubt it—but that is your unbelieving
nature—our little ones are real beauties,
always a pound or two plumper than others
of their age; and yet it don’t tire you half so
much to nurse them as it does other people’s
babies. Why, bless you, my wife would be
tired out in half the time, if her neighbor had
asked her to see to a strange youngster, but
her own children don’t seem to tire her at
all. Now my belief is that it all comes of
their having been born at home.</p>

<p>Just so it is with everything else: our lane
is the most beautiful for twenty miles round,
because our home is in it; and my garden is
a perfect paradise, for no other particular
reason than this very good one, that it belongs
to the old house at home.</p>

<p>Husbands should try to make home happy
and holy. It is an ill bird that fouls its own
nest, a bad man who makes his home wretched.
Our house ought to be a little church, with
holiness to the Lord over the door; but it
ought never to be a prison, where there is
plenty of rule and order, but little love and
no pleasure.</p>

<p>Married life is not all sugar, but grace in
the heart will keep away most of the sours.
Godliness and love can make a man, like a
bird in a hedge, sing among thorns and
briars, and set others a-singing too. It should
be the husband’s pleasure to please his wife,
and the wife’s care to care for her husband.
He is kind to himself who is kind to his
wife. I am afraid some men live by the rule
of self, and when that is the case home happiness
is a mere sham. When husbands and
wives are well yoked, how light their load
becomes!</p>

<p>It is not every couple that is a pair, and
the more’s the pity. In a true home all the
strife is which can do the most to make the
family happy. A home should be a Bethel,
not a Babel. The husband should be the
house-band, binding all together like a corner-stone,
but not crushing everything like a
millstone.</p>

<p>Nothing is improved by anger, unless it be
the arch of a cat’s back. A man with his
back up is spoiling his figure. People look
none the handsomer for being red in the face.
It takes a great deal out of a man to get into
a towering rage; it is almost as unhealthy as
having a fit, and time has been when men
have actually choked themselves with passion,
and died on the spot. Whatever wrong
I suffer, it cannot do me half so much hurt
as being angry about it; for passion shortens
life and poisons peace.</p>

<p>When once we give way to temper, temper
will get right of way, and come in easier
every time. He that will be in a pet for any
little thing, will soon be out at elbows about
nothing at all. A thunder-storm curdles the
milk, and so does a passion sour the heart
and spoil the character.</p>

<h4>LITTLE PEARL AND HER MOTHER.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Nathaniel Hawthorne.</span></p>

<p>Hawthorne is justly regarded as one of the masters of English prose,
although the shadowed side of his life predominated and often gave a
somewhat gloomy tinge to his writings. Yet through the morbid drapery
by which he surrounds himself the light of his superb genius shines
brilliantly. His style is a model of clearness, choice words and elevated
sentiment. The extract given below is from “The Scarlet Letter,” one of
his best works of fiction, and, in fact, one of the best that enriches
our American literature. He possessed great originality, a rare power
of analyzing character, a delicate and exquisite humor and marvelous
felicity in the use of language. Mr. Hawthorne was born at Salem,
Massachusetts, in 1804, and died in 1864.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">So the mother and little Pearl were
admitted into the hall of entrance.
With many variations, suggested
by the nature of his building-materials,
diversity of climate, and a different
mode of social life, Governor Bellingham had
planned his new habitation after the residences
of gentlemen of fair estate in his
native land.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a wide and reasonably
lofty hall, extending through the whole depth
of the house, and forming a medium of general
communication, more or less directly,
with all the other apartments. At one extremity,
this spacious room was lighted by
the windows of the two towers, which formed
a small recess on either side of the portal.
At the other end, though partly muffled by
a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated
by one of those embowed hall-windows which
we read of in old books, and which was provided
with a deep and cushioned seat.</p>

<p>Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome,
probably of the Chronicles of England, or
other such substantial literature; even as, in
our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on
the centre-table, to be turned over by the
casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted
of some ponderous chairs, the backs of
which were elaborately carved with wreaths
of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the
same taste; the whole being of Elizabethan
age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred
hither from the governor’s paternal
home.</p>

<p>On the table—in token that the sentiment
of old English hospitality had not been left
behind—stood a large pewter tankard, at the
bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl peeped
into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant
of a recent draught of ale.</p>

<p>On the wall hung a row of portraits, representing
the forefathers of the Bellingham
lineage, some with armor on their breasts,
and others with stately ruffs and robes of
peace. All were characterized by the sternness
and severity which old portraits so invariably
put on; as if they were the ghosts,
rather than the pictures, of departed worthies,
and were gazing with harsh and intolerant
criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of
living men.</p>

<p>At about the center of the oaken panels
that lined the hall was suspended a suit of
mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic,
but of the most modern date; for it had been
manufactured by a skillful armorer in London
the same year in which Governor Bellingham
came over to New England. There
was a steel headpiece, a cuirass, a gorget and
greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword
hanging beneath; all, and especially the
helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished
as to glow with white radiance and scatter an
illumination everywhere about upon the floor.</p>

<p>This bright panoply was not meant for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
mere idle show, but had been worn by the
governor on many a solemn muster and
training field, and had glittered, moreover,
at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war.
For, though bred a lawyer, and accustomed
to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye and Finch
as his professional associates, the exigencies
of this new country had transformed Governor
Bellingham into a soldier, as well as a
statesman and ruler.</p>

<p>Little Pearl—who was as greatly pleased
with the gleaming armor as she had been
with the glittering frontispiece of the house—spent
some time looking into the polished
mirror of the breastplate.</p>

<p>“Mother,” cried she, “I see you here.
Look! Look!”</p>

<p>Hester looked, by way of humoring the
child; and she saw that, owing to the peculiar
effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet
letter was represented in exaggerated and
gigantic proportions, so as to be greatly the
most prominent feature of her appearance.
In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind
it.</p>

<p>Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar
picture in the headpiece, smiling at her mother
with the elfish intelligence that was so
familiar an expression on her small physiognomy.
That look of naughty merriment
was likewise reflected in the mirror, with so
much breadth and intensity of effect, that it
made Hester Prynne feel as if it could not
be the image of her own child, but of an imp
who was seeking to mold itself into Pearl’s
shape.</p>

<h4>THE BABY IN THE BATH-TUB.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Grace Greenwood.</span></p>

<p>The following selection is an excellent example of sprightly and
vivacious writing, a kind of composition that is always entertaining
to the reader. Under the assumed name of Grace Greenwood, Mrs. Sarah
J. Lippincott was for many years a well-known and popular contributor
to various periodicals. She also published several volumes, including
works of fiction and stories of travel. She wrote poems that possessed
much merit, thus exhibiting a wide range of talent. Her fine thoughts
were expressed in a style of great ease, simplicity and beauty. Mrs.
Lippincott was born in Onondaga County, New York, in 1825, and died in
1898.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Annie! Sophie! come up quick,
and see baby in her bath-tub!”
cries a charming little maiden,
running down the wide stairway of an old
country house, and half-way up the long hall,
all in a fluttering cloud of pink lawn, her
soft dimpled cheeks tinged with the same
lovely morning hue.</p>

<p>In an instant there is a stir and gush of
light laughter in the drawing-room, and
presently, with a movement a little more
majestic and elder-sisterly, Annie and Sophie
float noiselessly through the hall and up the
soft-carpeted ascent, as though borne on their
respective clouds of blue and white drapery,
and take their way to the nursery, where a
novel entertainment awaits them. It is the
first morning of the eldest married sister’s
first visit home, with her first baby; and the
first baby, having slept late after its journey,
is about to take its first bath in the old
house.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, if here isn’t mother, forgetting
her dairy, and Cousin Nellie, too,
who must have left poor Ned all to himself
in the garden, lonely and disconsolate, and I
am torn from my books, and Sophie from
her flowers, and all for the sake of seeing a
nine-months-old baby kicking about in a
bath-tub! What simpletons we are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Thus Miss Annie, the <i>proude ladye</i> of the
family; handsome, haughty, with perilous
proclivities toward grand socialistic theories,
transcendentalism, and general strong-mindedness;
pledged by many a saucy vow to a
life of single dignity and freedom, given to
studies artistic, æsthetic, philosophic, and
ethical; a student of Plato, an absorber of
Emerson, an exalter of her sex, a contemner
of its natural enemies.</p>

<p>“Simpletons, are we?” cries pretty Elinor
Lee, aunt of the baby on the other side, and
“Cousin Nellie” by love’s courtesy, now
kneeling close by the bath-tub, and receiving
on her sunny braids a liberal baptism
from the pure, plashing hands of babyhood,—“simpletons,
indeed! Did I not once see
thee, O Pallas-Athene, standing rapt before
a copy of the ‘Crouching Venus?’</p>

<p>“And this is a sight a thousand times
more beautiful; for here we have color,
action, life, and such grace as the divinest
sculptors of Greece were never able to entrance
in marble. Just look at these white,
dimpled shoulders, every dimple holding a
tiny, sparkling drop,—these rosy, plashing
feet and hands,—this laughing, roguish face,—these
eyes, bright and blue and deep as
lakes of fairy land,—these ears, like dainty sea
shells,—these locks of gold, dripping diamonds,—and
tell me what cherub of Titian,
what Cupid of Greuze, was ever half so
lovely? I say, too, that Raphael himself
would have jumped at the chance of painting
Louise, as she sits there, towel in hand, in
all the serene pride and chastened dignity of
young maternity—of painting her as <i>Madonna</i>.”</p>

<h4>CANDACE’S OPINIONS.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Harriet Beecher Stowe.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe is particularly happy in portraying negro character. It
requires for this a great appreciation of humor, and her writings abound
in this, while her imagination and fine command of language make many of
her writings brilliant and even poetical.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe is the most celebrated American authoress. Her “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” has been more widely read than any other work of fiction ever
published. While in this work her conspicuous genius appears to fine
advantage, she has nevertheless written other works, some of them
describing New England life and character, which are masterpieces. She
was born at Litchfield, Conn., on the 14th of June, 1812, and died at
Hartford July 1st, 1896.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I intend,” said Mr. Marvyn, “to
make the same offer to your husband,
when he returns from work
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Laus, Mass’r—why, Cato, he’ll do jes’
as I do—dere a’n’t no kind o’ need o’ askin’
him. Course he will.”</p>

<p>A smile passed round the circle, because
between Candace and her husband there
existed one of those whimsical contrasts
which one sometimes sees in married life.
Cato was a small-built, thin, softly-spoken
negro, addicted to a gentle chronic cough;
and, though a faithful and skillful servant,
seemed, in relation to his better half, much
like a hill of potatoes under a spreading
apple-tree. Candace held to him with a
vehement and patronizing fondness, so devoid
of conjugal reverence as to excite the comments
of her friends.</p>

<p>“You must remember, Candace,” said a
good deacon to her one day, when she was
ordering him about at a catechizing, “you
ought to give honor to your husband; the
wife is the weaker vessel.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> de weaker vessel?” said Candace,
looking down from the tower of her ample
corpulence on the small, quiet man whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
she had been fledging with the ample folds
of a worsted comforter, out of which his little
head and shining bead-eyes looked, much
like a blackbird in a nest—“<i>I</i> de weaker
vassel! Umph!”</p>

<p>A whole woman’s rights convention could
not have expressed more in a day than was
given in that single look and word. Candace
considered a husband as a thing to be
taken care of—a rather inconsequent and
somewhat troublesome species of pet, to be
humored, nursed, fed, clothed, and guided
in the way that he was to go—an animal
that was always losing off buttons, catching
colds, wearing his best coat every day, and
getting on his Sunday hat in a surreptitious
manner for week-day occasions; but she
often condescended to express it as her
opinion that he was a blessing, and that she
didn’t know what she’d do if it wasn’t for
Cato.</p>

<p>She sometimes was heard expressing herself
very energetically in disapprobation of
the conduct of one of her sable friends, named
Jinny Stiles, who, after being presented with
her own freedom, worked several years to
buy that of her husband, but became afterwards
so disgusted with her acquisition, that
she declared she would “neber buy anoder
nigger.”</p>

<p>“Now, Jinny don’t know what she’s talkin’
about,” she would say. “S’pose he does
cough and keep her awake nights, and take
a little too much sometimes, a’n’t he better’n
no husband at all? A body wouldn’t seem
to hab nuffin to lib for, ef dey hadn’t an old
man to look arter. Men is nate’lly foolish
about some tings—but dey’s good deal better’n
nuffin.”</p>

<p>And Candace, after this condescending remark,
would lift with one hand a brass kettle
in which poor Cato might have been
drowned, and fly across the kitchen with it
as if it were a feather.</p>

<h4>MIDSUMMER IN THE VALLEY OF THE RHINE.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By George Meredith.</span></p>

<p>An example of beautiful description.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">An oppressive slumber hung about the
forest-branches. In the dells and
on the heights was the same
dead heat. Here where the
brook tinkled it was no cool-lipped sound,
but metallic, and without the spirit of
water. Yonder in a space of moonlight
on lush grass, the beams were as white
fire to sight and feeling. No haze spread
around. The valleys were clear, defined to
the shadows of their verges; the distances
sharply distinct, and with the colors of day
but slightly softened.</p>

<p>Richard beheld a roe moving across a
slope of sward far out of rifle-mark. The
breathless silence was significant, yet the
moon shone in a broad blue heaven. Tongue
out of mouth trotted the little dog after him;
couched panting when he stopped an instant;
rose weariedly when he started afresh. Now
and then a large white night-moth flitted
through the dusk of the forest.</p>

<p>On a barren corner of the wooded highland
looking inland stood gray topless ruins
set in nettles and rank grass-blades. Richard
mechanically sat down on the crumbling
flints to rest, and listened to the panting of
the dog. Sprinkled at his feet were emerald
lights: hundreds of glow-worms studded the
dark dry ground.</p>

<p>He sat and eyed them, thinking not at all.
His energies were expended in action. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
sat as a part of the ruins, and the moon
turned his shadow westward from the south.
Overhead, as she declined, long ripples of
silver cloud were imperceptibly stealing toward
her. They were the van of a tempest.
He did not observe them, or the leaves beginning
to chatter. When he again pursued
his course with his face to the Rhine, a huge
mountain appeared to rise sheer over him,
and he had it in his mind to scale it. He
got no nearer to the base of it for all his
vigorous outstepping. The ground began
to dip; he lost sight of the sky. Then
heavy thunder-drops struck his cheek, the
leaves were singing, the earth breathed, it
was black before him and behind. All at
once the thunder spoke. The mountain he
had marked was bursting over him.</p>

<p>Up started the whole forest in violent fire.
He saw the country at the foot of the hills to
the bounding Rhine gleam, quiver, extinguished.
Then there were pauses; and the
lightning seemed as the eye of heaven, and
the thunder as the tongue of heaven, each
alternately addressing him; filling him with
awful rapture.</p>

<h4>THE POWER OF NATURAL BEAUTY.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Ralph Waldo Emerson.</span></p>

<p>“The Sage of Concord,” as Mr. Emerson was called, expresses the estimate
the American public placed upon his writings. His profound thought and
originality are unquestioned. To these grand qualities he added a poetic
imagination which diffused a fine glow over all his productions.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson was born in Boston in 1803, graduated from Harvard College
in 1821, and entered the ministry of the Unitarian Church, from which,
however, he shortly resigned, and soon devoted himself to literary
pursuits. His works have a high reputation among scholars and speculative
thinkers. His style is singularly terse and at times almost abrupt, but
his thoughts are masterly and striking. He died in 1882.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Beauty is the mark God sets upon
virtue. Every natural action is
graceful. Every heroic act is
also decent, and causes the place
and the bystanders to shine. We are taught
by great actions that the universe is the
property of every individual in it.</p>

<p>Every rational creature has all nature for
his dowry and estate. It is his if he will.
He may divest himself of it; he may creep
into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom,
as most men do; but he is entitled to the
world by his constitution. In proportion
to the energy of his thought and will, he
takes up the world into himself. “All those
things for which men plough, build, or sail,
obey virtue;” said an ancient historian.
“The winds and waves,” said Gibbon, “are
always on the side of the ablest navigators.”
So are the sun and moon and all the stars of
heaven.</p>

<p>When a noble act is done—perchance in a
scene of great natural beauty; when Leonides
and his three hundred martyrs consume
one day in dying, and the sun and moon
come each and look at them once in the
steep defile of Thermopylæ; when Arnold
Winkelreid, in the high Alps, under the
shadow of the avalanche, gathers in his side
a sheaf of Austrian spears to break the line
for his comrades; are not these heroes entitled
to add the beauty of the scene to the
beauty of the deed? When the bark of
Columbus nears the shore of America;—before
it the beach lined with savages, fleeing
out of all their huts of cane; the sea behind;
and the purple mountains of the Indian
Archipelago around, can we separate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
man from the living picture? Does not the
New World clothe his form with her palm
groves and savannahs as fit drapery?</p>

<p>Ever does natural beauty steal in like air,
and envelop great actions. When Sir Harry
Vane was dragged up the Tower-hill sitting
on a sled, to suffer death, as the champion of
the English laws, one of the multitude cried
out to him, “You never sate on so glorious
a seat.” Charles II., to intimidate the citizens
of London, caused the patriot Lord
Russel to be drawn in an open coach through
the principal streets of the city, on his way to
the scaffold. “But,” to use the simple narrative
of his biographer, “the multitude imagined
they saw liberty and virtue sitting
by his side.”</p>

<p>In private places, among sordid objects, an
act of truth or heroism seems at once to draw
to itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its
candle. Nature stretcheth out her arms to
embrace man, only let his thoughts be of
equal greatness. Willingly does she follow
his steps with the rose and the violet, and
bend her lines of grandeur and grace to the
decoration of her darling child. Only let
his thoughts be of equal scope, and the frame
will suit the picture. A virtuous man is in
unison with her works, and makes the central
figure of the visible sphere.</p>

<p>The noonday darkness of the American
forest, the deep, echoing, aboriginal woods,
where the living columns of the oak and fir
tower up from the ruins of the trees of the
last millennium; where, from year to year,
the eagle and the crow see no intruder; the
pines, bearded with savage moss, yet touched
with grace by the violets at their feet; the
broad, cold lowland, which forms its coat of
vapor with the stillness of subterranean crystallization;
and where the traveler, amid the
repulsive plants that are native in the swamp,
thinks with pleasing terror of the distant
town; this beauty—haggard and desert
beauty, which the sun and the moon, the
snow and the rain repaint and vary, has never
been recorded by art, yet is not indifferent to
any passenger.</p>

<p>All men are poets at heart. They serve
nature for bread, but her loveliness overcomes
them sometimes. What mean these
journeys to Niagara; these pilgrims to the
White Hills? Men believe in the adaptations
of utility always. In the mountains they
may believe in the adaptations of the eye.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the changes of geology have
a relation to the prosperous sprouting of the
corn and peas in my kitchen garden; but
not less is there a relation of beauty between
my soul and the dim crags of Agiocochook
up there in the clouds. Every man, when
this is told, hearkens with joy, and yet his
own conversation with nature is still unsung.</p>

<p class="dropcap">To aid you in writing compositions a lengthy list of subjects is here
furnished. These, you will see, are adapted to persons of various ages
and capacities. Many of them are comparatively simple and require no
profound thought, while others are deep enough to tax all your powers of
reason.</p>

<p>Do not choose a subject that is too abstruse and difficult. Plain
narration and description should go before profound argument. Yet do not
be satisfied with a simple theme if you are capable of writing upon one
that demands more study and thought. When you have chosen your subject,
you should be guided by the practical hints and directions contained in
the first pages of this volume, which you should faithfully study.</p>

<p>Many of the subjects here presented will require a good deal of reading
and research before you can write upon them intelligently. This is true
especially of the historical and biographical subjects. If you find
history to be a fascinating study, as it is to most persons, you will
become so filled and enamored with your theme, that you can write upon it
easily.</p>

<p>Never consider it too much trouble to prepare yourself thoroughly to
write your compositions. If you would have nuggets of gold you must
dig for them. Success is worth all it costs, however much that may be.
Remember Bulwer Lytton’s saying, “The pen is mightier than the sword.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">We use words to express ideas and thoughts. The best words are those
which best express the thought or idea. All writers are frequently at a
loss for the exact word or phrase that will express their meaning the
most forcibly, and are compelled to ransack and search their vocabulary
in order to get out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The number of words used by the majority of persons is very small, and
they are therefore in constant danger of the fault of repetition. We do
not like to hear a speaker use the same word too frequently. To do so
detracts seriously from the force and beauty of his address. While there
are instances in which a repetition of a word is called for, and to make
use of another would weaken the sentence and fail to fully give the
meaning of the writer or speaker, it is nevertheless true that constant
repetitions are not only a blemish, but a fault that should be corrected.</p>

<p>For the purpose of avoiding too much repetition in writing and speaking
it is necessary to have a Dictionary of words of similar meaning. A
Synonym is one of two or more words of similar significance which may
often be used interchangeably. An Antonym is a word of opposite meaning.
In the following list the Synonyms are first given; then follow, in
parenthesis, the Antonyms, or words of opposite meaning.</p>

<p>All persons who would acquire an elegant style in literary composition,
correspondence or ordinary conversation, will find this comprehensive
Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms of great value. Jewels of thought
should be set in appropriate language.</p>

<p>In this table the letter <i>a</i> means adjective; <i>v</i> means verb;

<h3>HOW TO READ AND RECITE.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Good readers and reciters are extremely
rare, and it is because sufficient
time and study are not devoted
to the art of elocution. Not one
educated man in ten can read a paragraph
in a newspaper so effectively that to listen to
him is a pleasure, and not a pain.</p>

<p>Many persons are unable so to express the
words as to convey their meaning. They
pervert the sense of the sentence by emphasizing
in the wrong place, or deprive it of all
sense by a monotonous gabble, giving no
emphasis to any words they utter. They
neglect the “stops,” as they are called; they
make harsh music with their voices; they
hiss, or croak, or splutter, or mutter—everything
but speak the words set down for them
as they would have talked them to you in
conversation.</p>

<p>Why should this be? Why should correct
reading be rare, pleasant reading rarer still,
and good reading found only in one person
in ten thousand? Let me urge you with
all earnestness to become an accomplished
reader and reciter. This is something to be
coveted, and it is worth your while to acquire
it, though it cost you much time and labor.
Attend to the rules here furnished.</p>

<h4>Cultivation of the Voice.</h4>

<p>Accustom yourself to reading and reciting
aloud. Some of our greatest orators have
made it a practice to do this in the open air,
throwing out the voice with full volume, calling
with prolonged vowel sounds to some
object in the distance, and thus strengthening
the throat and lungs. Every day you should
practice breathings; by which I mean that
you should take in a full breath, expand the
lungs to their full capacity, and then emit
the breath slowly, and again suddenly with
explosive force. A good, flexible voice is
the first thing to be considered.</p>

<h4>Distinct Enunciation.</h4>

<p>When you hear a person read or speak
you are always pleased if the full quantity is
given to each syllable of every word. Only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
in this way can the correct meaning of the
sentence be conveyed. People who are partially
deaf will tell you that they are not
always able to hear those who speak the
loudest, but those who speak the most distinctly.
Do not recite to persons who are
nearest to you, but rather glance at those
who are farthest away, and measure the
amount of volume required to make them
hear.</p>

<h4>Emphasis.</h4>

<p>Some word or words in every sentence
are more important, and require greater
emphasis than others. You must get at
the exact meaning of the sentence, and be
governed by this. The finest effects can be
produced by making words emphatic where
the meaning demands it. Look well to this.</p>

<h4>Pauses.</h4>

<p>Avoid a sing-song, monotonous style of
delivery. Break the flow where it is required;
you will always notice how skillfully a
trained elocutionist observes the proper
pauses. Have such command of yourself
that you do not need to hurry on with your
recitation at the same pace from beginning
to end. The pause enables the hearer to
take in the meaning of the words, and is
therefore always to be observed.</p>

<h4>Gestures.</h4>

<p>Speak with your whole body, not merely
with your tongue and lips. It is permissible
to even stamp with your foot when the sense
calls for it. Speak with your eyes, with your
facial expression, with your fingers, with
your clenched fist, with your arm, with the
pose of your body, with all the varying attitudes
needful to express what you have to
say with the greatest effect.</p>

<p>Stand, as a rule, with one foot slightly in
advance of the other, the weight of the body
resting upon the foot farther back. Do not
be tied to one position; hold yourself at
liberty to change your position and move
about. Do not hold your elbows close to
your body, as if your arms were strapped to
your sides. Make the gesture in point of
time slightly in advance of the word or
words it is to illustrate.</p>

<h4>The Magnetic Speaker.</h4>

<p>It has always been said that the poet is
born, but the orator is made. This is not
wholly correct, for the more magnetism you
were born with, the better speaker you will
become. Still, the indefinable thing called
magnetism is something that can be cultivated;
at least you can learn how to show
it, and permit it to exert its wonderful influence
over your hearers.</p>

<p>Put yourself into your recitations in such
a way that the thoughts and sentiments you
express shall, for the time being, be your
own. Every nerve and muscle of your body,
every thought and emotion of your mind, in
short, your whole being should be enlisted.
You should become transformed, taking on
the character required by the reading or
recitation, and making it your own.</p>

<p>Persons who can thus lose themselves in
what they are saying, and throw into their
recitations all the force and magnetism of
which they are capable, are sure to meet
with success.</p>

<h4>Self-Command.</h4>

<p>Young persons naturally feel embarrassed
when they face an audience. Some of our
greatest orators have known what this is, and
were compelled to labor hard to overcome it.
Practice alone will give you confidence, unless
you possess it already, and this is true of only
a few young persons.</p>

<p>Do your utmost to control yourself. Let
your will come into play; strong will, governing
every emotion of the mind and movement
of the body, is absolutely essential. Do
not be brazen, but self-confident.</p>

<h4>THE SONG OF OUR SOLDIERS AT SANTIAGO.</h4>

<p>When the destruction of Admiral Cervera’s fleet became known before
Santiago, the American soldiers cheered wildly, and, with one accord,
through miles of trenches, began singing “The Star Spangled Banner.” You
should preface the recitation with the foregoing statement.</p>

<h5>LESSON TALK.</h5>

<p>This selection is inspiring. It is brimful of the
glow of patriotism. To deliver it, therefore, in a
dull, listless, indifferent manner would suppress the
natural sentiment of the piece and rob it of the effect
it would otherwise produce. Be <i>alive</i>; not wooden
and nerveless. If you were standing in a crowd and
a brass band should come along and strike up the
“Star Spangled Banner,” you would instantly see
the change that would come over the assembled
throng. Every heart would be moved, every face
would be filled with expression, every nerve would
seem to tingle.</p>

<p>When you are to deliver a selection of this kind,
come before your audience with your body straightened
to its full height, your shoulders thrown back,
and your head erect. For the time being you are a
patriot, and are saying some grand things about the
Stars and Stripes and about our brave heroes who
have carried “Old Glory” to victory on so many
battlefields.</p>

<p>Your manner must indicate that you appreciate
their heroism, that you are ready to extol it, and that
you expect your hearers to share the emotions of
your own breast. You should know what tones of
voice your are to employ in expressing most effectively
the sentiments of the piece, what gestures should
be used and what words are to be emphasized.</p>

<p>1. Taking now the first verse, you should let the
tones of your voice out full and clear on the first
line, lowering your voice on the second line; then
letting your voice ring out again on the third line,
and again subduing it on the fourth. Here is a fine
opportunity for contrast between strong tones and
tones subdued and suggestive of death. It would
not be amiss to give the words “their latest breath”
in a whisper. Prolong the sound on the word “roll.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
The word “thrilling” should be expressed with
energetic impulse, and the voice lowered, yet round
and full, on the last line.</p>

<p>2. With hands elevated as high as the shoulders
and palms turned outward, expressive of wonder and
almost alarm, deliver the first line of the second
verse. Suddenly change to confidence and courage
in the next three lines. Express nothing here that
could suggest timidity, but rather the opposite.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">should be spoken in a thoughtful mood, with head
dropped on breast; then lift it as you speak the two
lines that follow, the last of which refers to the field
of battle and should be designated, as in <a href="#gesture2">Figure 2 of
Typical Gestures</a>, found in the preceding pages.</p>

<p>3. At the beginning of verse three, elevate your
voice and prolong the tones. The words “never
runs” are emphatic; put stress on them. On the
fifth and sixth lines of this verse use the gesture for
Exaltation, <a href="#gesture11">Figure 11 of Typical Gestures</a>—arm lifted
as high as the head and palm opened upward, giving
the arm at the same time a circular motion. The last
two lines should be delivered with hands clasped, palm
to palm, in front of the breast, and eyes turned upward.</p>

<h4>THE VICTOR OF MARENGO.</h4>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="140" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Napoleon was sitting in his tent;
before him lay a map of Italy. He
took four pins and stuck them
up; measured, moved the pins, and measured
again. “Now,” said he, “that is right; I
will capture him there!” “Who, sir?” said
an officer. “Milas, the old fox of Austria.
He will retire from Genoa, pass Turin, and
fall back on Alexandria. I shall cross the
Po, meet him on the plains of Laconia, and
conquer him there,” and the finger of the
child of destiny pointed to Marengo.</p>

<p>2. Two months later the memorable campaign
of 1800 began. The 20th of May saw
Napoleon on the heights of St. Bernard. The
22d, Lannes, with the army of Genoa, held
Padua. So far, all had been well with Napoleon.
He had compelled the Austrians to
take the position he desired; reduced the
army from one hundred and twenty thousand
to forty thousand men; dispatched Murat
to the right, and June 14th moved forward
to consummate his masterly plan.</p>

<p>3. But God threatened to overthrow his
scheme! A little rain had fallen in the Alps,
and the Po could not be crossed in time.
The battle was begun. Milas, pushed to
the wall, resolved to cut his way out; and
Napoleon reached the field to see Lannes
beaten—Champeaux dead—Desaix still
charging old Milas, with his Austrian phalanx
at Marengo, till the consular guard gave
way, and the well-planned victory was a terrible
defeat. Just as the day was lost, Desaix,
the boy General, sweeping across the field at
the head of his cavalry, halted on the eminence
where stood Napoleon.</p>

<p>4. There was in the corps a drummer-boy,
a gamin whom Desaix had picked up in the
streets of Paris. He had followed the
victorious eagle of France in the campaigns
of Egypt and Germany. As the columns
halted, Napoleon shouted to him: “Beat a
retreat!” The boy did not stir. “Gamin,
beat a retreat!” The boy stopped, grasped
his drum-sticks, and said: “Sir, I do not
know how to beat a retreat; Desaix never
taught me that; but I can beat a charge,—Oh!
I can beat a charge that will make the
dead fall into line. I beat that charge at the
Pyramid: I beat that charge at Mount Tabor:
I beat it again at the bridge of Lodi. May
I beat it here?”</p>

<p>5. Napoleon turned to Desaix, and said:
“We are beaten; what shall we do?” “Do?
Beat them! It is only three o’clock, and
there is time enough to win a victory yet.
Up! the charge! beat the old charge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Mount Tabor and Lodi!” A moment later
the corps, following the sword-gleam of Desaix,
and keeping step with the furious roll
of the gamin’s drum, swept down on the
host of Austrians. They drove the first line
back on the second—both on the third, and
there they died. Desaix fell at the first
volley, but the line never faltered, and as the
smoke cleared away the gamin was seen in
front of his line marching right on, and still
beating the furious charge.</p>

<p>6. Over the dead and wounded, over breastworks
and fallen foe, over cannon belching
forth their fire of death, he led the way to
victory, and the fifteen days in Italy were
ended. To-day men point to Marengo in
wonder. They admire the power and foresight
that so skillfully handled the battle
but they forget that a General only thirty
years of age made a victory of a defeat. They
forget that a gamin of Paris put to shame
“the child of destiny.”</p>

<h5>LESSON TALK.</h5>

<p>A story or a narrative like this should be read in a
more easy, conversational manner than is demanded
for selections more tragic or oratorical. Yet a great
variety of expression can be introduced into this
piece, and without it, the reading will be tame.</p>

<p>1. In the first part of this verse spread your hands
forward, then outward with the palms downward, to
indicate the map of Italy which is lying before the
great general. In a tone of triumph, accompanied
with firmness and decision, Napoleon says, “I will
capture him there.” Use the gesture for defiance,
<a href="#gesture23">Figure 23, in Typical Gestures</a>. Your body must be
immediately relaxed as you ask the question, “Who,
sir?” Let the answer be given with utterance somewhat
rapid, still indicating firmness and decision.</p>

<p>2. This verse is easy narrative and should be recited
as you would tell it to a friend in conversation.
The words “masterly plan” in the last line are
emphatic.</p>

<p>3. In the first line of this verse use the gesture
shown in <a href="#gesture24">Figure 24 of Typical Gestures</a>, indicating
that Napoleon’s scheme was rejected by God and
brought to nought. The style of narrative here is
very concise and the sentences should follow one
another in quick succession. “Milas, pushed to the
wall,” should be expressed by <a href="#gesture4">Figure 4 of Typical
Gestures</a>. When you come to the words “the well-planned
victory was a terrible defeat,” stretch forth
your right arm as in <a href="#gesture6">Figure 6 of Typical Gestures</a>,
dropping it to your side heavily on the last word.
Point to the boy general sweeping across the field
and to the eminence where Napoleon stood. Champeaux
is pronounced <i>Shon-po</i>; Desaix is pronounced
<i>De-say</i>.</p>

<p>4. Here you drop again into easy narrative until
you come to the words, “Beat a retreat!” These
are to be shouted as if you were the officer on the
battlefield giving the command. Put intense expression
into the boy’s appeal, as he states that he does
not know how to beat a retreat, and pleads to be permitted
to beat a charge. There is opportunity here
for grand effect as you deliver these lines.</p>

<p>5 and 6. Use the gesture for Defiance on the
words, “Up! the charge!” You are ordering an
advance, resolved to win the victory. The remainder
of this verse and the following is narrative and demands
quite a different rendering from the words of
command in other parts of the selection. If you
recite it in such a way as to express the full meaning
it will captivate your hearers.</p>

<h5>LESSON TALK.</h5>

<p>The quiet humor of this piece stands in strong
contrast to selections of a tragic character, and if it
is recited in an easy pleasant way, it is sure to be
appreciated by all who hear it. Adapt your voice
and manner, therefore, to the style of narrative.</p>

<p>1. With the right hand extended designate the
farm horse, large and lean. Drawl out the word
lazy in the next line, and continue this slow utterance
to the end of the verse.</p>

<p>2. The sentiment changes in the next verse and
requires more animation. In the first line make the
gesture shown in <a href="#gesture21">Figure 21 of Typical Gestures</a>, in
the beginning of Part II. of this volume. Become
more animated as you describe the maiden’s eyes
and the soft waves of her golden hair.</p>

<p>3. The young couple reach the parsonage and
your manner should suggest theirs; they have come
on very important business. Express the embarrassment
of the young man as he asks the question:
“What shall we do?” etc. Give a half look of surprise
as you refer to the contents of the pillow-case.</p>

<p>4. In a half tone of rebuke the maiden answers,
“Let us wait,” saying encouragingly that there is no
need to borrow trouble. She evidently believes the
parson will be quite willing to take the fee.</p>

<p>5. Let your utterance become more rapid as you
picture the bridegroom springing from the horse.
With uplifted, clenched hand knock on the door,
and then portray the half fright of the parson as he
answers the knock.</p>

<p>6. Here is an opportunity for a genuine touch of humor.
Cry out as the young man would to the maiden
by the gate, “Come in; he says he’ll take the beans!”
She jumps to the ground. Make the gesture of
<a href="#gesture16">Figure 16 in Typical Gestures</a>.</p>

<p>7. Act out the effort of carrying the pillow-case
through the open door and throwing it upon the parlor
floor. Do not let your facial expression be too
serious. You should know how to smile without
looking silly.</p>

<p>8. Here again in the first line make the gesture in
<a href="#gesture16">Figure 16</a>, and with elevated pitch and joyous expression
picture the young couple as they ride away.
With fervent tones and uplifted hands recite the last
two lines of the piece. A good recital for a parlor
entertainment.</p>

<h5>LESSON TALK.</h5>

<p>The beautiful lesson taught in this selection is apparent
to every one. In reciting it you have, therefore,
the advantage of presenting a reading that commends
itself to all hearers, the sentiment of which is
admirable. The piece will speak for itself, and there is
a vast difference between a reading of this description
and one that has nothing specially to commend it.</p>

<p>And here let me say something concerning your
choice of recitations. First of all, they should be
adapted to your range of capacity. It is simply grotesque
for one to whom only tragedy is natural to attempt
to recite humorous pieces. On the other hand,
it is a great mistake for one who is expert in nothing
but humorous selections to attempt to recite tragedy.</p>

<p>The error with many readers lies in attempting to
do that for which they are not naturally fitted. The
selections in this volume are so diversified that you
ought to be able to find what is especially suited to
your ability.</p>

<p>Nothing is inserted here simply because it is good
poetry or good prose. There are thousands of readings
and recitations, so called, that do not afford the
elocutionist any opportunity to display his powers.
They are a dull monotony from beginning to end.
They fill the pages of the book, but nobody wants
them. Every recitation in this volume has been
chosen because it has some special merit and is
adapted to call out the powers of the reader.</p>

<p>1. Taking now the recitation before us you have
in the first verse the King’s command, which you
should deliver in a tone of authority, extending the
right hand on the fourth line.</p>

<p>And this affords me an opportunity to say that your
gestures should never be thrust forward or sideways
in an angular manner, but with something approaching
a curve. Do not make gestures as though you were
a prize-fighter and were thrusting at an imaginary foe.
Remember that the line of beauty is always the curve.</p>

<p>2. This verse is narrative and requires a different
expression from the one preceding it. Extend your
right hand on the second line in which it is stated
that the sculptor went upon his way, curving your arm
outward and then letting it fall gently by your side.</p>

<p>3. In this verse the sculptor is in perplexity. He
is trying to study out the riddle, and to express this
you should use <a href="#gesture22">Figure 22 of Typical Gestures</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>4 and 5. These verses are also narrative, the only
thing to be noted being the trembling timidity of the
sculptor in the last part of the 5th verse. This
should be indicated by the tones of your voice and
general manner.</p>

<p>6. This is dialogue, and while the inflexions required
are those of ordinary conversation, do not let
your manner be too tame.</p>

<p>7. Make the announcement contained in this verse
with evident satisfaction. The last line is emphatic
and should be spoken with full volume.</p>

<p>8. Make a pause after the word statue in the first
line and recite the remainder of this line in a tone of
surprise. In the second line make the gesture in
<a href="#gesture13">Figure 13 of Typical Gestures</a>. Let your facial expression
indicate satisfaction.</p>

<h5>LESSON TALK.</h5>

<p>This selection is in a lighter vein than the others
that have gone before. It is adapted to a boy eight
or ten years old. While the humor is not of a boisterous
character, the piece is very pleasing when recited
by a boy who knows how to take in the situation
and can put on a look of natural surprise.</p>

<p>Recitations by little people are always interesting
to older persons. The young should be taught to recite
in public. While this need not make them bold,
it does give them confidence, which is very desirable
for them to have.</p>

<p>Moreover, it helps them to become graceful in manner
if they are properly trained, and takes away the
awkwardness which makes many young persons appear
to a disadvantage. Added to all this the cultivation
of the memory derived from learning recitations,
and learning them so thoroughly that they cannot be
forgotten through any temporary embarrassment, and
you will readily see that the noble art of elocution is
an essential part of every young person’s education.</p>

<p>The selection before us is not a difficult one to recite.
In the first verse emphasis should be placed
on the word “am,” and the question should be asked
in a tone of surprise. Put your hand to your head in
speaking of that “awful bump.”</p>

<p>In the next verse lift your right hand with a sudden
motion and use any gesture with which you can
best indicate the cracking of the whip. When you
come to the words “off he threw me,” use the gesture
in <a href="#gesture24">Figure 24 of Typical Gestures</a>. Emphasize
the word “he” in the last line.</p>

<p>In verse three open your eyes in half wonder and
put on an expressive smile as you speak of grandma’s
pies, cakes, doughnuts, tarts, etc. Make it plain that
you enjoy your visit to grandma’s.</p>

<p>With elevated voice and accents of delight refer
to the gift of the little pony in the last verse. Speak
the first “ho!” rather quickly; then prolong the
sound on the second “ho!” In the last line the
words “am I?” are emphatic. You are puzzled to
know how many little boys you are. Pause a moment
and look as if expecting an answer.</p>

<p>Nothing renders a recitation more acceptable
to any audience than snatches
of music, some of the words being sung,
if the reader has a voice for singing.
The change from reciting to singing should
be made easily, and you should be fully
confident that you can carry through the
part to be expressed by the notes of
music, and sing the words effectively.</p>

<p>This will require practice, but will repay
you for the time spent in preparation. Selections
for song and recital combined are here
presented, which cannot fail to captivate your
audience if they are skillfully rendered.</p>

stand near each other, face to face. It can be made very amusing. The
change from reciting to singing adds greatly to the effect. Sing the

<h4>THE GREAT NAVAL BATTLE OF SANTIAGO.</h4>

<p>Hold your body erect, but not awkwardly stiff, let every nerve be
tense, your voice full and round, and let your manner indicate that you
have a grand story to relate, as you recite Admiral Schley’s thrilling
description of the great naval battle at Santiago. You are depicting the
scene as though you were there and yourself won the brilliant victory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="80" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">One hour before the Spaniards appeared
my quartermaster on the
Brooklyn reported to me that Cervera’s
fleet was coaling up. This was just
what I expected, and we prepared everything
for a hot reception. Away over the hills
great clouds of smoke could be faintly seen
rising up to the sky. A little later and the
smoke began to move towards the mouth of
the harbor. The black cloud wound in and
out along the narrow channel, and every eye
on board the vessels in our fleet strained
with expectation.</p>

<p>The sailor boys were silent for a full hour
and the grim old vessels lay back like tigers
waiting to pounce upon their prey. Suddenly
the whole Spanish fleet shot out of the
mouth of the channel. It was the grandest
spectacle I ever witnessed. The flames were
pouring out of the funnels, and as it left the
channel the fleet opened fire with every gun
on board. Their guns were worked as rapidly
as possible, and shells were raining
around like hail.</p>

<p>It was a grand charge. My first impression
was that of a lot of maddened bulls,
goaded to desperation, dashing at their tormentors.
The storm of projectiles and shells
was the hottest imaginable. I wondered
where they all came from. Just as the vessels
swung around the Brooklyn opened up
with three shells, and almost simultaneously
the rest of the fleet fired. Our volley was a
terrible shock to the Spaniards, and so surprised
them that they must have been badly
rattled.</p>

<p>When our fleet swung around and gave
chase, we not only had to face the fire from
the vessels, but were bothered by a cross-fire
from the forts on either side, which
opened on our fleet as soon as the Spaniards
shot out of the harbor. The engagement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
lasted three hours, but I hardly knew
what time was. I remember crashing holes
through the Spanish Admiral’s flagship, the
Maria Teresa, and giving chase to the Colon.</p>

<p>I was on the bridge of the Brooklyn
during the whole engagement, and at times
the smoke was so dense that I could not see
three yards ahead of me. The shells from
the enemy’s fleet were whistling around and
bursting everywhere, except where they
could do some damage. I seemed to be the
only thing on the vessel not protected by
heavy armor, and oh! how I would have
liked to get behind some of that armor!</p>

<p>I don’t know how I kept my head, but I
do know that I surprised myself by seeing
and knowing all that was going on, and I
could hear my voice giving orders to do just
what my head thought was right, while my
heart was trying to get beneath the shelter of
the armored deck. How do I account for
such a victory with so little loss? That
would mean how do I account for the rain
of Spanish shell not doing more execution?
They fought nobly and desperately, but they
were not a match for our Yankee officers
and sailors.</p>

<p>I was proud of the boys in our fleet during
that engagement. They knew just what
their guns could do, and not one shot was
wasted. Their conduct was wonderful. It
was inspiring. It was magnificent. Men
who can stand behind big guns and face a
black storm of shells and projectiles as coolly
as though nothing was occurring; men who
could laugh because a shell had missed hitting
them; men who could bet one another
on shots and lay odds in the midst of the
horrible crashing; men who could not
realize that they were in danger—such men
are wonders, and we have a whole navy of
wonders.</p>

<h4>HOBSON’S DARING DEED.</h4>

<p>Let your tones of voice be strong and bold, not boisterous, and give to
the most spirited lines full force. You are depicting a daring deed, and
it must not be done in a weak, timid, hesitating way, but with strong
utterance and emphasis. The sinking of the steam collier Merrimac was a
famous exploit.</p>

<h4>THE YANKEES IN BATTLE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">For courage and dash there is no parallel
in history to this action of the
Spanish Admiral. He came, as he
knew, to absolute destruction. There was
one single hope. That was that the Spanish
ship Cristobal Colon would steam faster than
the American ship Brooklyn. The spectacle
of two torpedo-boat destroyers, paper shells
at best, deliberately steaming out in broad
daylight in the face of the fire of battleships
can only be described in one way. It was
Spanish, and it was ordered by the Spanish
General Blanco. The same may be said of
the entire movement.</p>

<p>In contrast to the Spanish fashion was the
cool, deliberate Yankee work. The American
squadron was without sentiment apparently.
The ships went at their Spanish
opponents and literally tore them to pieces.
Admiral Cervera was taken aboard the Iowa
from the Gloucester, which had rescued him,
and he was received with a full Admiral’s
guard. The crew of the Iowa crowded aft
over the turrets, half naked and black with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
powder, as Cervera stepped over the side
bareheaded. The crew cheered vociferously.
The Admiral submitted to the fortunes of
war with a grace that proclaimed him a
thoroughbred.</p>

<p>The officers of the Spanish ship Vizcaya
said they simply could not hold their crews
at the guns on account of the rapid fire
poured upon them. The decks were flooded
with water from the fire hose, and the blood
from the wounded made this a dark red.
Fragments of bodies floated in this along
the gun deck. Every instant the crack of
exploding shells told of new havoc.</p>

<p>The torpedo boat Ericsson was sent by
the flagship to the help of the Iowa in the
rescue of the Vizcaya’s crew. Her men saw
a terrible sight. The flames, leaping out
from the huge shot holes in the Vizcaya’s
sides, licked up the decks, sizzling the flesh
of the wounded who were lying there
shrieking for help. Between the frequent explosions
there came awful cries and groans
from the men pinned in below. This carnage
was chiefly due to the rapidity of the
American fire.</p>

<p>From two 6-pounders 400 shells were fired
in fifty minutes. Up in the tops the marines
banged away with 1-pounders, too excited
to step back to duck as the shells
whistled over them. One gunner of a secondary
battery under a 12-inch gun was
blinded by smoke and saltpetre from the
turret, and his crew were driven off, but
sticking a wet handkerchief over his face,
with holes cut for his eyes, he stuck to his
gun.</p>

<p>Finally, as the 6-pounders were so close
to the 8-inch turret as to make it impossible
to stay there with safety, the men were
ordered away before the big gun was fired,
but they refused to leave. When the 3-inch
gun was fired, the concussion blew two
men of the smaller gun’s crew ten feet
from their guns and threw them to the
deck as deaf as posts. Back they went
again, however, and were again blown away,
and finally had to be dragged away from
their stations. Such bravery and such dogged
determination under the heavy fire were
of frequent occurrence on all the ships engaged.</p>

<h4>THE BANNER BETSEY MADE.</h4>

<p>The first American flag, including the thirteen stars and stripes, was
made by Mrs. Betsey Ross, a Quaker lady of Philadelphia. Recite these
lines in an easy, conversational manner, yet with animation. In this and
similar recitations never let your voice sink down into your throat, as
if you were just ready to faint away. Your delivery should never be dull,
least of all in patriotic pieces.</p>

<h4>A RACE FOR DEAR LIFE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The battleships Brooklyn, Oregon and
Texas pushed ahead after the Spanish
ships Colon and Almirante Oquendo,
which were now running the race of their
lives along the coast. When Admiral Cervera’s
flagship, the Almirante Oquendo, suddenly
headed in shore, she had the Brooklyn
and Oregon abeam and the Texas astern.
The Brooklyn and Oregon pushed on after
the Cristobal Colon, which was making fine
time, and which looked as if she might escape,
leaving the Texas to finish the Almirante
Oquendo. This work did not take
long. The Spanish ship was already burning.
Just as the Texas got abeam of her
she was shaken by a loud and mighty explosion.</p>

<p>The crew of the Texas started to cheer.
“Don’t cheer, because the poor devils are
dying!” called Captain Philip, and the Texas
left the Almirante Oquendo to her fate to
join in the chase of the Cristobal Colon.</p>

<p>That ship, in desperation, was ploughing
the waters at a rate that caused the fast
Brooklyn trouble. The Oregon made great
speed for a battleship, and the Texas made
the effort of her life. Never since her trial
trip had she made such time. The Brooklyn
might have proved a match to the Cristobal
Colon in speed, but was not supposed to be
her match in strength.</p>

<p>It would never do to allow even one of the
Spanish ships to get away. Straight into the
west the strongest chase of modern times
took place. The Brooklyn headed the pursuers.
She stood well out from the shore
in order to try to cut off the Cristobal Colon
at a point jutting out into the sea far ahead.
The Oregon kept a middle course about a
mile from the cruiser. The Desperate Don
ran close along the shore, and now and then
he threw a shell of defiance. The old Texas
kept well up in the chase under forced
draught for over two hours.</p>

<p>The fleet Spaniard led the Americans a
merry chase, but she had no chance. The
Brooklyn gradually forged ahead, so that
the escape of the Cristobal Colon was cut off.
The Oregon was abeam of the Colon then,
and the gallant Don gave it up. He headed
for the shore, and five minutes later down
came the Spanish flag. None of our ships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
were then within a mile of her, but her escape
was cut off. The Texas, Oregon and
Brooklyn closed in on her, and stopped their
engines a few hundred yards away.</p>

<p>With the capture of the Cristobal Colon
the battle was ended, and there was great
rejoicing on all our ships. Meantime the
New York, with Admiral Sampson on
board, and the Vixen were coming up on

<h4>THE SINKING OF THE MERRIMAC.</h4>

<p>The sinking of the ship Merrimac at the mouth of Santiago harbor, by
Lieutenant Hobson, was one of the most daring exploits on record. It is
here told in his own words. Although this selection is simple narrative,
you should recite it in a spirited manner, with strong tones of voice,
and show by your demeanor and expression that you are relating an event
worthy of admiration.</p>

<p>The figures printed in the text refer you to the corresponding numbers
in “Typical Gestures,” near the beginning of Part II. of this volume.
Use other gestures that are appropriate, not in a stiff awkward way, but
gracefully, making them appear, not forced, but natural.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I did not miss the entrance to the harbor,
I turned east until I got my
bearings and then made<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture6">6</a></span> for it, straight
in. Then came the firing. It was grand,<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture11">11</a></span>
flashing out first from one side of the harbor
and then from the other, from those big guns<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture2">2</a></span>
on the hills, the Spanish ship Vizcaya, lying
inside the harbor, joining in.</p>

<p>Troops from Santiago had rushed down
when the news of the Merrimac’s coming
was telegraphed and soon lined the foot of
the cliff, firing wildly across and killing each
other with the cross fire. The Merrimac’s
steering gear broke as she got to Estrella
Point. Only three of the torpedoes on her
side exploded when I touched the button.
A huge submarine mine caught her full amidships,
hurling the water high in the air and
tearing<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture25">25</a></span> a great rent in the Merrimac’s side.</p>

<p>Her stern ran upon Estrella Point. Chiefly
owing to the work done by the mine she
began to sink slowly. At that time she was
across the channel, but before she settled the
tide drifted her around. We were all aft,
lying on the deck. Shells<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture13">13</a></span> and bullets
whistled around. Six-inch shells from the
Vizcaya came tearing into the Merrimac,
crashing into wood and iron and passing
clear through while the plunging shots from
the fort broke through her decks.</p>

<p>“Not a man<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture3">3</a></span> must move,” I said, and it was
only owing to the splendid discipline of the men
that we all were not killed, as the shells rained
over us and minutes became hours of suspense.
The men’s mouths grew parched, but we must
lie there till daylight, I told them. Now and
again one or the other of the men lying
with his face glued to the deck and wondering
whether the next shell would not come our
way would say: “Hadn’t<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture3">3</a></span> we better drop off
now, sir?” but I said: “Wait<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture12">12</a></span> till daylight.”</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to get the
catamaran or raft anywhere but to the shore,
where the soldiers stood shooting, and I
hoped that by daylight we might be recognized
and saved. The grand old Merrimac
kept sinking. I wanted to go forward and
see the damage done there, where nearly all
the fire was directed, but one man said that
if I rose it would draw all the fire on the rest.
So I lay motionless. It was splendid<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture11">11</a></span> the way
these men behaved. The fire<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture6">6</a></span> of the soldiers,
the batteries and the Vizcaya was awful.</p>

<p>When the water came up on the Merrimac’s
decks the raft floated amid the wreckage, but
she was still made fast to the boom, and we
caught hold<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture23">23</a></span> of the edge and clung on, our
heads only being above water. One man
thought we were safer right<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture6">6</a></span> there; it was
quite light; the firing had ceased, except
that on the launch which followed to rescue
us, and I feared<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture20">20</a></span> Ensign Powell and his
men had been killed.</p>

<p>A Spanish launch<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture2">2</a></span> came toward the Merrimac.
We agreed to capture her and run.
Just as she came close the Spaniards saw us,
and a half-dozen marines jumped up and
pointed<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture2">2</a></span> their rifles at our heads. “Is there
any officer in that boat to receive a surrender
of prisoners of war?” I shouted. An old man
leaned out under the awning and held out<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#gesture6">6</a></span> his
hand. It was the Spanish Admiral Cervera.</p>

<h4>A SPOOL OF THREAD.</h4>

<h4>THE YOUNG PATRIOT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="80" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">One Fourth of July, when Abraham
Lincoln was a boy, he heard an oration
by old ’Squire Godfrey. As in
the olden days, the ’Squire’s oration
was full of Washington; inspiring in the heart
of young Lincoln an enthusiasm that sent him
home burning with a desire to know more of
the great man who heretofore had seemed
more of a dream than a reality. Learning
that a man some six miles up the creek
owned a copy of Washington’s life, Abraham
did not rest that night until he had footed
the whole distance and begged the loan of
the book.</p>

<p>“Sartin, sartin,” said the owner. “The book
is fairly well worn, but no leaves are missin’,
and a lad keen enough to read as to walk six
miles to get a book, ought to be encouraged.”</p>

<p>It was a much-worn copy of Weem’s “Life
of Washington,” and Abe, thanking the
stranger for his kindness, walked back under
the stars, stopping every little while to catch
a glimpse of the features of the “Father of
his Country” as shown in the frontispiece.</p>

<p>After reaching home, tired as he was, he
could not close his eyes until, by the light
of a pine knot, he had found out all that was
recorded regarding the boyhood of the man
who had so suddenly sprung into prominence
in his mind. In that busy harvest season he
had no time to read or study during the day,
but every night, long after the other members
of the family were sleeping peacefully, Abe
lay, stretched upon the floor with his book
on the hearth, reading, reading, reading, the
pine knot in the fireplace furnishing all the
light he needed, the fire within burning with
such intense heat as to kindle a blaze that
grew and increased until it placed him in the
highest seat of his countrymen.</p>

<p>What a marvelous insight into the human
heart did Abraham Lincoln get between the
covers of that wonderful book. The little
cabin grew to be a paradise as he learned
from the printed pages the story of one great
man’s life. The barefooted boy in buckskin
breeches, so shrunken that they reached only
halfway between the knee and ankle, actually
asked himself whether there might not be
some place—great and honorable, awaiting
him in the future.</p>

<p>Before this treasured “Life of Washington”
was returned to its owner, it met with
such a mishap as almost to ruin it. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
book, which was lying on a board upheld by
two pegs, was soaked by the rain that dashed
between the logs one night, when a storm
beat with unusual force against the north
end of the cabin. Abraham was heartbroken
over the catastrophe, and sadly carried the
book back to its owner, offering to work to
pay for the damage done. The man consented,
and the borrower worked for three
days at seventy-five cents a day, and thus
himself became the possessor of the old,
faded, stained book—a book that had more
to do with shaping his life, perhaps, than any
one other thing.</p>

<p>Abe had not expected to take the book
back with him, but merely to pay for the
damage done, and was surprised when the
man handed it to him when starting. He
was very grateful, however, and when he
gave expression to his feelings the old man
said, patting him on the shoulder: “You
have earned it, my boy, and are welcome to
it. It’s a mighty fine thing to have a head
for books, just as fine to have a heart for
honesty, and if you keep agoin’ as you have
started, maybe some day you’ll git to be
President yourself. President Abraham Lincoln!
That would sound fust rate, fust rate,
now, wouldn’t it, sonny?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a very handsome name, to be
sure,” Abe replied, looking as though he
thought such an event possible, away off, in
the future. “No, it’s not a very very handsome
name, but I guess it’s about as handsome
as its owner,” he added, glancing at the
reflection of his homely features in the little
old-fashioned, cracked mirror hanging opposite
where he sat.</p>

<p>“Handsome is that handsome does,” said
the old farmer, nodding his gray head in an
approving style. “Yes, indeedy; handsome
deeds make handsome men. We hain’t a
nation of royal idiots, with one generation
of kings passin’ away to make room for another.
No, sir-ee. In this free country of
ourn, the rich and poor stand equal chances,
and a boy without money is just as likely to
work up to the Presidential chair as the one
who inherits from his parents lands and stocks
and money and influence. It’s brains that
counts in this land of liberty, and Abraham
Lincoln has just as much right to sit in the
highest seat in the land as Washington’s
son himself, if he had had a son, which he
hadn’t.”</p>

<p>Who knows but the future War President
of this great Republic received his first aspirations
from this kindly neighbor’s words?</p>

<h4>CAPTAIN MOLLY AT MONMOUTH.</h4>

<p>One of the famous battles of the Revolution was that of Monmouth, New
Jersey, which was fought on the 28th of June, 1778. General Washington
was in command on the American side, and General Sir Henry Clinton was
commander-in-chief of the British forces. The British troops met with
a decisive defeat. The wife of an Irish gunner on the American side
who went by the name of Molly had followed her husband to the battle.
During the engagement he was shot down. With the most undaunted heroism
Molly rushed forward and took his place at the gun and remained there
throughout the thickest of the fight. In reciting this graphic account of
her courageous deed you should show great spirit and animation, pointing
her out as she takes her husband’s place, and in glowing manner describe
her patriotism.</p>

<p>If you should read or recite this tragic selection in a dull monotone,
as most persons read poetry, the effect would be ludicrous. The brave
captain is dying. With gasping utterance, signs of weakness and appealing
looks, his words should be delivered. Some of the sentences should be
whispered. Do not attempt to recite this piece until you have mastered it

<h4>THE GREAT NAVAL BATTLE OF MANILA.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">With the United States Flag Flying
at all their mastheads, our ships
moved to the attack in line ahead,
with a speed of eight knots, first passing in
front of Manila, where the action was begun
by three batteries mounting guns powerful
enough to send a shell over us at a distance of
five miles. The Concord’s guns boomed out a
reply to these batteries with two shots. No
more were fired, because Admiral Dewey could
not engage with these batteries without sending
death and destruction into the crowded city.</p>

<p>As we neared Cavite two very powerful
submarine mines were exploded ahead of the
flagship. The Spaniards had misjudged our
position. Immense volumes of water were
thrown high in air by these destroyers, but
no harm was done to our ships.</p>

<p>Admiral Dewey had fought with Farragut
at New Orleans and Mobile Bay, where he
had his first experience with torpedoes. Not
knowing how many more mines there might
be ahead, he still kept on without faltering.
No other mines exploded, however, and it is
believed that the Spaniards had only these
two in place.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes later the shore battery
at Cavite Point sent over the flagship a shot
that nearly hit the battery in Manila, but
soon the guns got a better range, and the
shells began to strike near us, or burst close
aboard from both the batteries and the Spanish
vessels. The heat was intense. Men
stripped off all clothing except their trousers.</p>

<p>As the Admiral’s flagship, the Olympia,
drew nearer all was as silent on board as if
the ship had been empty, except for the
whirr of blowers and the throb of the engines.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Suddenly a shell burst directly over
us. From the boatswain’s mate at the after
5-inch gun came a hoarse cry. “Remember
the Maine!” arose from the throats of five
hundred men at the guns. This watchword
was caught up in turrets and fire-rooms,
wherever seaman or fireman stood at his post.</p>

<p>“Remember the Maine!” had rung out for
defiance and revenge. Its utterance seemed
unpremeditated, but was evidently in every
man’s mind, and, now that the moment had
come to make adequate reply to the murder
of the Maine’s crew, every man shouted what
was in his heart.</p>

<p>The Olympia was now ready to begin the
fight. “You may fire when ready, Captain
Gridley,” said the Admiral, and at nineteen
minutes of six o’clock, at a distance of 5,500
yards, the starboard 8-inch gun in the forward
turret roared forth a compliment to the
Spanish forts. Presently similar guns from
the Baltimore and the Boston sent 250-pound
shells hurtling toward the Spanish ships Castilla
and the Reina Christina for accuracy.
The Spaniards seemed encouraged to fire
faster, knowing exactly our distance, while we
had to guess theirs. Their ship and shore
guns were making things hot for us.</p>

<p>The piercing scream of shot was varied
often by the bursting of time fuse shells,
fragments of which would lash the water like
shrapnel or cut our hull and rigging. One
large shell that was coming straight at the
Olympia’s forward bridge fortunately fell
within less than one hundred feet away. One
fragment cut the rigging exactly over the
heads of some of the officers. Another struck
the bridge gratings in line with it. A third
passed just under Dewey and gouged a hole in
the deck. Incidents like these were plentiful.</p>

<p>“Capture and destroy Spanish squadron,”
were Dewey’s orders. Never were instructions
more effectually carried out. Within
seven hours after arriving on the scene of
action nothing remained to be done. The
Admiral closed the day by anchoring off the
city of Manila and sending word to the Governor
General that if a shot was fired from the
city at the fleet he would lay Manila in ashes.</p>

<p>What was Dewey’s achievement? He
steamed into Manila Bay at the dead hour of
the night, through the narrower of the two
channels, and as soon as there was daylight
enough to grope his way about he put his
ships in line of battle and brought on an engagement,
the greatest in many respects in
ancient or modern warfare. The results are
known the world over—every ship in the
Spanish fleet destroyed, the harbor Dewey’s
own, his own ships safe from the shore batteries,
owing to the strategic position he occupied,
and Manila his whenever he cared to take it.</p>

<p>Henceforth, so long as ships sail and flags
wave, high on the scroll that bears the names
of the world’s greatest naval heroes will be
written that of George Dewey.</p>

<h4>THE SINKING OF THE SHIPS.</h4>

<p>This is an excellent selection for any one who can put dramatic force
into its recital. Picture to your imagination the “Sinking of the
Ships,” and then describe it to your hearers as though the actual scene
were before you. You have command in these words, “Now, sailors, stand
by,” etc.; rapid utterance in these words, “And the Oregon flew,” etc.;
subdued tenderness in the words, “Giving mercy to all,” etc. In short,
the whole piece affords an excellent opportunity for intense dramatic
description.</p>

<h4>PERRY’S CELEBRATED VICTORY ON LAKE ERIE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Perry’s famous battle on Lake Erie
raised the spirits of the Americans.
The British had six ships, with
sixty-three guns. The Americans
had nine ships, with fifty-four guns, and the
American ships were much smaller than the
English. At this time Perry, the American
commander, was but twenty-six years of age.
His flagship was the Lawrence. The ship’s
watchword was the last charge of the Chesapeake’s
dying Commander—“Don’t give up
the ship.” The battle was witnessed by
thousands of people on shore.</p>

<p>At first the advantage seemed to be with
the English. Perry’s flagship was riddled
by English shots, her guns were dismounted
and the battle seemed lost. At the supreme
crisis Perry embarked in a small boat with
some of his officers, and under the fire of
many cannon passed to the Niagara, another
ship of the fleet, of which he took command.</p>

<p>After he had left the Lawrence she hauled
down her flag and surrendered, but the other
American ships carried on the battle with
such fierce impetuosity that the English
battle-ship in turn surrendered, the Lawrence
was retaken and all the English ships yielded
with the exception of one, which took flight.
The Americans pursued her, took her and
came back with the entire British squadron.
In the Capitol at Washington is a historical
picture showing this famous victory.</p>

<p>In Perry’s great battle on Lake Erie was
shown the true stuff of which American
sailors are made. Perry was young, bold
and dashing, but withal, he had the coolness
and intrepidity of the veteran. History
records few braver acts than his passage in
an open boat from one ship to another under
the galling fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>The grand achievements of the American
navy are brilliant chapters in our country’s
history. When the time comes for daring
deeds, our gallant tars are equal to the occasion.
Coolness in battle, splendid discipline,
perfect marksmanship and a patriotism that
glories in the victory of the Stars and Stripes,
combine to place the officers and men of our
navy in the front rank of the world’s greatest
heroes.</p>

<h4>THE CAPTURE OF QUEBEC.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">General Wolfe, the English
commander, saw that he must take
Quebec by his own efforts or not
at all. He attempted several diversions
above the city in the hope of drawing Montcalm,
the French commander, from his intrenchments
into the open field, but Montcalm
merely sent De Bougainville with fifteen
hundred men to watch the shore above Quebec
and prevent a landing. Wolfe fell into
a fever, caused by his anxiety, and his
despatches to his government created the
gravest uneasiness in England for the success
of his enterprise.</p>

<p>Though ill, Wolfe examined the river with
eagle eyes to detect some place at which a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
landing could be attempted. His energy
was rewarded by his discovery of the cove
which now bears his name. From the shore
at the head of this cove a steep and difficult
pathway, along which two men could scarcely
march abreast, wound up to the summit of
the heights and was guarded by a small force
of Canadians.</p>

<p>Wolfe at once resolved to effect a landing
here and ascend the heights by this path.
The greatest secrecy was necessary to the
success of the undertaking, and in order to
deceive the French as to his real design,
Captain Cook, afterwards famous as a great
navigator, was sent to take soundings and
place buoys opposite Montcalm’s camp, as if
that were to be the real point of attack. The
morning of the thirteenth of September was
chosen for the movement, and the day and
night of the twelfth were spent in preparations
for it.</p>

<p>At one o’clock on the morning of the thirteenth
a force of about five thousand men
under Wolfe, with Monckton and Murray, set
off in boats from the fleet, which had ascended
the river several days before, and dropped
down to the point designated for the landing.
Each officer was thoroughly informed
of the duties required of him, and each
shared the resolution of the gallant young
commander, to conquer or to die. As the
boats floated down the stream, in the clear,
cool starlight, Wolfe spoke to his officers of
the poet Gray, and of his “Elegy in a
Country Churchyard.” “I would prefer,”
said he, “being the author of that poem to
the glory of beating the French to-morrow.”
Then in a musing voice he repeated the
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Await alike the inexorable hour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The paths of glory lead but to the grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a short while the landing-place was
reached, and the fleet, following silently,
took position to cover the landing if necessary.
Wolfe and his immediate command
leaped ashore and secured the pathway.
The light infantry, who were carried by the
tide a little below the path, climbed up the
side of the heights, sustaining themselves by
clinging to the roots and shrubs which lined
the precipitous face of the hill. They
reached the summit and drove off the picket-guard
after a light skirmish. The rest of
the troops ascended in safety by the pathway.
Having gained the heights, Wolfe
moved forward rapidly to clear the forest,
and by daybreak his army was drawn up on
the Heights of Abraham, in the rear of the
city.</p>

<p>Montcalm was speedily informed of the
presence of the English. “It can be but a
small party come to burn a few houses and
retire,” he answered incredulously. A brief
examination satisfied him of his danger, and
he exclaimed in amazement: “Then they
have at last got to the weak side of this
miserable garrison. We must give battle
and crush them before mid-day.”</p>

<p>He at once despatched a messenger for De
Bougainville, who was fifteen miles up the
river, and marched from his camp opposite
the city to the Heights of Abraham to drive
the English from them. The opposing forces
were about equal in numbers, though the
English troops were superior to their adversaries
in discipline, steadiness and determination.</p>

<p>The battle began about ten o’clock and
was stubbornly contested. It was at length
decided in favor of the English. Wolfe
though wounded several times, continued to
direct his army until, as he was leading
them to a final charge, he received a
musket ball in the breast. He tottered and
called to an officer near him: “Support me;
let not my brave fellows see me drop.” He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
was borne tenderly to the rear, and water
was brought him to quench his thirst.</p>

<p>At this moment the officer upon whom he
was leaning cried out: “They run! they
run!” “Who run?” asked the dying hero,
eagerly. “The French,” said the officer,
“give way everywhere.” “What,” said
Wolfe, summoning up his remaining strength,
“do they run already? Go, one of you, to
Colonel Burton; bid him march Webb’s
regiment with all speed to Charles River to
cut off the fugitives.” Then a smile of contentment
overspreading his pale features, he
murmured: “Now, God be praised, I die
happy,” and expired. He had done his
whole duty, and with his life had purchased
an empire for his country.</p>

<h4>THE DEFEAT OF GENERAL BRADDOCK.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Washington, who, at this time,
was a subordinate officer, was well
convinced that the French and Indians
were informed of the movements of the
army and would seek to interfere with it
before its arrival at Fort Duquesne, which
was only ten miles distant, and urged Braddock
to throw in advance the Virginia Rangers,
three hundred strong, as they were experienced
Indian fighters.</p>

<p>Braddock angrily rebuked his aide, and as
if to make the rebuke more pointed, ordered
the Virginia troops and other provincials to
take position in the rear of the regulars.</p>

<p>In the meantime the French at Fort Duquesne
had been informed by their scouts of
Braddock’s movements, and had resolved to
ambuscade him on his march. Early on the
morning of the ninth a force of about two
hundred and thirty French and Canadians
and six hundred and thirty-seven Indians,
under De Beaujeu, the commandant at Fort
Duquesne, was despatched with orders to
occupy a designated spot and attack the enemy
upon their approach. Before reaching
it, about two o’clock in the afternoon, they
encountered the advanced force of the English
army, under Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas
Gage, and at once attacked them with spirit.</p>

<p>The English army at this moment was
moving along a narrow road, about twelve
feet in width, with scarcely a scout thrown
out in advance or upon the flanks. The engineer
who was locating the road was the
first to discover the enemy, and called out:
“French and Indians!” Instantly a heavy
fire was opened upon Gage’s force, and his
indecision allowed the French and Indians to
seize a commanding ridge, from which they
maintained their attack with spirit.</p>

<p>The regulars were quickly thrown into
confusion by the heavy fire and the fierce
yells of the Indians, who could nowhere be
seen, and their losses were so severe and sudden
that they became panic-stricken.</p>

<p>The only semblance of resistance maintained
by the English was by the Virginia
Rangers, whom Braddock had insulted at the
beginning of the day’s march. Immediately
upon the commencement of the battle, they
had adopted the tactics of the Indians, and
had thrown themselves behind trees, from
which shelter they were rapidly picking off
the Indians. Washington entreated Braddock
to follow the example of the Virginians,
but he refused, and stubbornly endeavored
to form them in platoons under the fatal
fire that was being poured upon them by
their hidden assailants. Thus through his
obstinacy many useful lives were lost.</p>

<p>The officers did not share the panic of the
men, but behaved with the greatest gallantry.
They were the especial marks of the Indian
sharpshooters, and many of them were killed
or wounded. Two of Braddock’s aides were
seriously wounded, and their duties devolved
upon Washington in addition to his own.
He passed repeatedly over the field, carrying
the orders of the commander and encouraging
the men. When sent to bring up the
artillery, he found it surrounded by Indians,
its commander, Sir Peter Halket, killed, and
the men standing helpless from fear.</p>

<p>Springing from his horse, he appealed to
the men to save the guns, pointed a field-piece
and discharged it at the savages and
entreated the gunners to rally. He could
accomplish nothing by either his words or
example. The men deserted the guns and
fled. In a letter to his brother, Washington
wrote: “I had four bullets through my coat,
two horses shot under me, yet escaped unhurt,
though death was levelling my companions
on every side around me.”</p>

<h4>QUICK! MAN THE LIFE-BOAT!</h4>

<p>This selection demands great vivacity and intense dramatic expression.
Each reference to the life-boat requires rapid utterance, elevated pitch
and strong tones of command. Point to the life-boat; you are to see it,
and make your audience see it. They will see it in imagination if you do;
that is, if you speak and act as if you stood on the shore and actually
saw the life-boat hurrying to the rescue.</p>

<h4>THE BURNING SHIP.</h4>

<p>The general character of this selection is intensely dramatic. It is a
most excellent piece for any one who has the ability and training to
do it full justice. The emotions of agony, horror and exultation are
here, and should be made prominent. Let the cry of “Fire!” ring out in
startling tones, and let your whole manner correspond with the danger and
the excitement of the scene. The rate throughout should be rapid.</p>

<h4>THE UNKNOWN SPEAKER.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is the Fourth day of July, 1776.</p>

<p>In the old State House in the city of
Philadelphia are gathered half a hundred
men to strike from their limbs the shackles of
British despotism. There is silence in the
hall—every face is turned toward the door
where the committee of three, who have been
out all night penning a parchment, are soon
to enter. The door opens, the committee
appears. The tall man with the sharp features,
the bold brow, and the sand-hued hair,
holding the parchment in his hand, is a Virginia
farmer, Thomas Jefferson. That stout-built
man with stern look and flashing eye,
is a Boston man, one John Adams. And
that calm-faced man with hair drooping in
thick curls to his shoulders, that is the Philadelphia
printer, Benjamin Franklin.</p>

<p>The three advance to the table.</p>

<p>The parchment is laid there.</p>

<p>Shall it be signed or not? A fierce debate
ensues, Jefferson speaks a few bold words.
Adams pours out his whole soul. The deep-toned
voice of Lee is heard, swelling in
syllables of thunder like music. But still
there is doubt, and one pale-faced man whispers
something about axes, scaffolds and a
gibbet.</p>

<p>“Gibbet?” echoed a fierce, bold voice
through the hall. “Gibbet? They may
stretch our necks on all the gibbets in the
land; they may turn every rock into a scaffold;
every tree into a gallows; every home
into a grave, and yet the words of that parchment
there can never die! They may pour
our blood on a thousand scaffolds, and yet
from every drop that dyes the axe a new
champion of freedom will spring into birth.
The British King may blot out the stars of
God from the sky, but he cannot blot out
His words written on that parchment there.
The works of God may perish. His words
never!</p>

<p>“The words of this declaration will live
in the world long after our bones are dust.
To the mechanic in his workshop they will
speak hope; to the slave in the mines, freedom;
but to the coward-kings, these words
will speak in tones of warning they cannot
choose but hear.</p>

<p>“They will be terrible as the flaming syllables
on Belshazzar’s wall! They will speak
in language startling as the trump of the
Archangel, saying: ‘You have trampled on
mankind long enough! At last the voice of
human woe has pierced the ear of God, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
called His judgment down! You have
waded to thrones through rivers of blood;
you have trampled on the necks of millions
of fellow-beings. Now kings, now purple
hangmen, for <i>you</i> come the days of axes and
gibbets and scaffolds.’</p>

<p>“Such is the message of that declaration
to mankind, to the kings of earth. And
shall we falter now? And shall we start
back appalled when our feet touch the very
threshold of Freedom?</p>

<p>“Sign that parchment! Sign, if the next
moment the gibbet’s rope is about your
neck! Sign, if the next minute this hall
rings with the clash of the falling axes!
Sign by all your hopes in life or death as
men, as husbands, as fathers, brothers, sign
your names to the parchment, or be accursed
forever!</p>

<p>“Sign, and not only for yourselves, but for
all ages, for that parchment will be the textbook
of freedom—the Bible of the rights of
men forever. Nay, do not start and whisper
with surprise! It is truth, your own hearts
witness it; God proclaims it. Look at this
strange history of a band of exiles and outcasts,
suddenly transformed into a people—a
handful of men weak in arms—but mighty
in God-like faith; nay, look at your recent
achievements, your Bunker Hill, your Lexington,
and then tell me, if you can, that God
has not given America to be free!</p>

<p>“It is not given to our poor human intellect
to climb to the skies, and to pierce the
councils of the Almighty One. But methinks
I stand among the awful clouds which
veil the brightness of Jehovah’s throne.</p>

<p>“Methinks I see the recording angel come
trembling up to that throne to speak his
dread message. ‘Father, the old world is
baptized in blood. Father, look with one
glance of thine eternal eye, and behold evermore
that terrible sight, man trodden beneath
the oppressor’s feet, nations lost in blood,
murder and superstition walking hand in
hand over the graves of their victims, and
not a single voice to whisper hope to
man!’</p>

<p>“He stands there, the angel, trembling
with the record of human guilt. But hark!
The voice of Jehovah speaks out from the
awful cloud: ‘Let there be light again!
Tell my people, the poor and oppressed, to
go out from the old world, from oppression
and blood, and build my altar in the
new!’</p>

<p>“As I live, my friends, I believe that to be
His voice! Yes, were my soul trembling on
the verge of eternity, were this hand freezing
in death, were this voice choking in the last
struggle, I would still with the last impulse
of that soul, with the last wave of that hand,
with the last gasp of that voice, implore
you to remember this truth—God has given
America to be free! Yes, as I sank into the
gloomy shadows of the grave, with my last
faint whisper I would beg you to sign that
parchment for the sake of the millions whose
very breath is now hushed in intense expectation
as they look up to you for the awful
words, ‘You are free!’”</p>

<p>The unknown speaker fell exhausted in his
seat; but the work was done.</p>

<p>A wild murmur runs through the hall.
“Sign!” There is no doubt now. Look
how they rush forward! Stout-hearted John
Hancock has scarcely time to sign his bold
name before the pen is grasped by another—another
and another. Look how the names
blaze on the parchment! Adams and Lee,
Jefferson and Carroll, Franklin and Sherman.</p>

<p>And now the parchment is signed.</p>

<p>Now, old man in the steeple, now bare your
arm and let the bell speak! Hark to the
music of that bell! Is there not a poetry in
that sound, a poetry more sublime than that
of Shakespeare and Milton? Is there not a
music in that sound that reminds you of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
sublime tones which broke from angel lips
when the news of the child Jesus burst on
the hill-tops of Bethlehem? For the tones
of that bell now come pealing, pealing, pealing,
“Independence now and Independence
forever.”</p>

<h4>CHILD LOST.</h4>

<p>It used to be a custom to have a man go through the town ringing a
bell and “crying” any thing was lost. You should imitate the crier, at
the same time swinging your hand as if ringing a bell. This selection
requires a great variety in the manner, pitch of the voice and gestures
of the reader.</p>

<h4>THE FACE ON THE FLOOR.</h4>

    <div class="verse indent0">The jewel I had treasured so had tarnished and was dead.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That’s why I took to drink, boys. Why, I never saw you smile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought you’d be amused and laughing all the while;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why, what’s the matter, friend? There’s a teardrop in your eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, laugh like me, ’tis only babes and women that should cry.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say, boys, if you’ll give me another whiskey, I’ll be glad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll draw right here, the picture of the face that drove me mad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me that piece of chalk with which you mark the base-ball score—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And you shall see the lovely Madeline upon the bar-room floor.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Another drink, and with chalk in hand, the vagabond began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To sketch a face that well might buy the soul of any man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, as he placed another lock upon the shapely head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a fearful shriek he leaped and fell across the picture—<i>dead</i>.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But now all is changed; I am vile, they are honored, they push me aside,</div>

<h4>THE SKELETON’S STORY.</h4>

<p>It will require all the dramatic power of which you are capable to recite
this selection and do it full justice. Be wide-awake, quick in tone and
gesture, shouting at one time, whispering at another, speaking with your
whole body. The emotions of fear and horror are especially prominent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is two miles ahead to the foot-hills—two
miles of parched turf and rocky
space. To the right—the left—behind,
is the rolling prairie. This broad valley
strikes the Sierra Nevadas and stops as
if a wall had been built across it.</p>

<p>Ride closer! What is this on the grass?
A skull here—a rib there—bones scattered
about as the wild beasts left them after the
horrible feast. The clean-picked skull grins
and stares—every bone and scattered lock
of hair has its story of a tragedy. And what
besides these relics? More bones—not
scattered, but lying in heaps—a vertebra
with ribs attached—a fleshless skull bleaching
under the summer sun. Wolves! Yes.
Count the heaps of bones and you will
find nearly a score. Open boats are picked
up at sea with neither life nor sign to
betray their secret. Skeletons are found
upon the prairie, but they tell a plain story
to those who halt beside them. Let us
listen:</p>

<p>Away off to the right you can see treetops.
Away off to the left you can see the
same sight. The skeleton is in line between
the two points. He left one grove to ride
to the other. To ride! Certainly; a mile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
away is the skeleton of a horse or mule. The
beast fell and was left there.</p>

<p>It is months since that ride, and the trail
has been obliterated. Were it otherwise,
and you took it up from the spot where the
skeleton horse now lies, you would find the last
three or four miles made at a tremendous pace.</p>

<p>“Step! step! step!”</p>

<p>What is it? Darkness has gathered over
mountain and prairie as the hunter jogs along
over the broken ground. Overhead the
countless stars look down upon him—around
him is the pall of night. There was a patter
of footsteps on the dry grass. He halts and
peers around him, but the darkness is too deep
for him to discover any cause for alarm.</p>

<p>“Patter! patter! patter!”</p>

<p>There it is again! It is not fifty yards
from where he last halted. The steps are
too light for those of an Indian.</p>

<p>“Wolves!” whispers the hunter, as a
howl suddenly breaks upon his ear.</p>

<p>Wolves! The gaunt, grizzly wolves of the
foot-hills—thin and poor and hungry and savage—the
legs tireless—the mouth full of teeth
which can crack the shoulder-bone of a buffalo.
He can see their dark forms flitting from point
to point—the patter of their feet upon the
parched grass proves that he is surrounded.</p>

<p>Now the race begins. A line of wolves
spread out to the right and left, and gallops
after—tongues out—eyes flashing—great
flakes of foam flying back to blotch stone
and grass and leave a trail to be followed by
the cowardly coyotes.</p>

<p>Men ride thus only when life is the stake. A
horse puts forth such speed only when terror
follows close behind and causes every nerve to
tighten like a wire drawn until the scratch of
a finger makes it chord with a wail of despair.
The line is there—aye! it is gaining! Inch by
inch it creeps up, and the red eye takes on a
more savage gleam as the hunter cries out to
his horse and opens fire from his revolvers.
A wolf falls on the right—a second on the
left. Does the wind cease blowing because it
meets a forest! The fall of one man in a mad
mob increases the determination of the rest.</p>

<p>With a cry so full of the despair that wells
up from the heart of the strong man when
he gives up his struggle for life that the
hunter almost believes a companion rides
beside him, the horse staggers—recovers—plunges
forward—falls to the earth. It was
a glorious struggle; but he has lost.</p>

<p>There is a confused heap of snarling, fighting,
maddened beasts, and the line rushes
forward again. Saddle, bridle, and blanket
are in shreds—the horse a skeleton. And
now the chase is after the hunter. He has
half a mile the start, and as he runs the veins
stand out, the muscles tighten, and he wonders
at his own speed. Behind him are the
gaunt bodies and the tireless legs. Closer,
closer, and now he is going to face fate like
a brave man should. He has halted. In an
instant a circle is formed about him—a circle
of red eyes, foaming mouths, and yellow
fangs which are to meet in his flesh.</p>

<p>There is an interval—a breathing spell.
He looks up at the stars—out upon the night.
It is his last hour, but there is no quaking—no
crying out to the night to send him aid.
As the wolves rest, a flash blinds their eyes—a
second—a third—and a fourth, and they
give before the man they had looked upon
as their certain prey. But it is only for a
moment. He sees them gathering for the
rush, and firing his remaining bullets among
them he seizes his long rifle by the barrel
and braces to meet the shock. Even a savage
would have admired the heroic fight he
made for life. He sounds the war-cry and
whirls his weapon around him, and wolf
after wolf falls disabled. He feels a strange
exultation over the desperate combat, and as
the pack give way before his mighty blows a
gleam of hope springs up in his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>It is only for a moment; then the circle
narrows. Each disabled beast is replaced
by three which hunger for blood. There is
a rush—a swirl—and the cry of despair is
drowned in the chorus of snarls as the pack
fight over the feast.</p>

<p>The gray of morning—the sunlight of noonday—the
stars of evening will look down
upon grinning skull and whitening bones,
and the wolf will return to crunch them
again. Men will not bury them. They will
look down upon them as we look, and ride
away with a feeling that ’tis but another dark
secret of the wonderful prairie.</p>

<h4>THE VULTURE OF THE ALPS.</h4>

<p>This selection is narrative, yet it is narrative intensely dramatic.
Imagine the feelings of a parent who sees the “youngest of his babes”
torn away from his embrace by a vulture and carried away in mid-air. Let
your tones, attitudes and gestures all be strong. Picture the flight of a
mountain eagle with uplifted arm, and depict with an expression of agony
the grief of the parent.</p>

<h4>NATHAN HALE, THE MARTYR SPY.</h4>

<p>After the disastrous defeat of the Americans on Long Island, Washington
desired information respecting the British position and movements.
Captain Nathan Hale, but twenty-one years old, volunteered to procure the
information. He was taken and hanged as a spy the day after his capture,
September 22, 1776. His patriotic devotion, and the brutal treatment he
received at the hands of his captors, have suggested the following. Put
your whole soul into this piece, especially Hale’s last speech. It rises
to the sublime.</p>

<h4>THE POWER OF HABIT.</h4>

<p>Adapted to the development of transition in pitch, and a very spirited
utterance. When you are able to deliver this as Mr. Gough did, you may
consider yourself a graduate in the art of elocution.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I remember once riding from Buffalo
to the Niagara Falls. I said to a gentleman,
“What river is that, sir?”</p>

<p>“That,” said he, “is Niagara River.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a beautiful stream,” said I;
“bright and fair and glassy. How far off are
the rapids?”</p>

<p>“Only a mile or two,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Is it <i>possible</i> that only a mile from us we
shall find the water in the turbulence which
it must show near the Falls?”</p>

<p>“You will find it so, sir.” And so I found
it; and the first sight of Niagara I shall never
forget.</p>

<p>Now, launch your bark on that Niagara
River; it is bright, smooth, beautiful and
glassy. There is a ripple at the bow;
the silver wake you leave behind adds to
your enjoyment. Down the stream you
glide, oars, sails, and helm in proper trim,
and you set out on your pleasure excursion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly some one cries out from the
bank, “Young men, ahoy!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“The rapids are below you!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! we have heard of the rapids;
but we are not such fools as to get there. If
we go too fast, then we shall up with the
helm, and steer to the shore; we will set the
mast in the socket, hoist the sail, and speed
to the land. Then on, boys; don’t be
alarmed, there is no danger.”</p>

<p>“Young men, ahoy there!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“The rapids are below you!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! we will laugh and quaff; all
things delight us. What care we for the
future? No man ever saw it. Sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof. We will enjoy
life while we may, will catch pleasure as it
flies. This is enjoyment; time enough to
steer out of danger when we are sailing
swiftly with the current.”</p>

<p>“Young men, ahoy!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Beware! beware! The rapids are below
you!”</p>

<p>“Now you see the water foaming all
around. See how fast you pass that point!
Up with the helm! Now turn! Pull hard!
Quick! quick! quick! pull for your lives!
pull till the blood starts from your nostrils,
and the veins stand like whip cords upon your
brow! Set the mast in the socket! hoist the
sail! Ah! ah! it is too late! Shrieking,
blaspheming, over they go.”</p>

<p>Thousands go over the rapids of intemperance
every year, through the power of habit,
crying all the while, “When I find out that
it is injuring me, I will give it up!”</p>

<h4>DIED ON DUTY.</h4>

    <div class="verse indent0">For doin’ his duty and doin’ it right, he was known all along the line,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bill was comin’ down the run, one Monday night, a pullin’ of No. 3,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But they done no good, ’twant no use; he had seen his last of wrecks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thar by the fire that lit up his brave face, poor Bill passed in his checks.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When they raised old 258 again, the story she did tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was that the hero in her cab had done his duty well;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They found her lever thrown hard, her throttle open wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her air applied so close and hard that every wheel must slide.</div>

<h4>PARRHASIUS AND THE CAPTIVE.</h4>

<p>This is a picture of inordinate ambition. It should be represented by
a voice of cold indifference to human suffering. The flame of selfish
passion is wild and frenzied.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And color clad them, his fine, earnest eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flashed with a passionate fire, and the quick curl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his thin nostril, and his quivering lip,</div>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO.</h4>

<p>This soul-stirring account of the historic battle where thrones and
empires were staked, is from the pen of the great French author whose
famous descriptions are unsurpassed by those of any other writer. In
reciting this piece every nerve must be tense, and soul and body must be
animated by the imaginary sight of the contending armies. Your utterance
should be somewhat rapid, the tones of your voice round and full, the
words of command given as a general would give them on the field of
battle, and you must picture to your hearers the thrilling scene in such
a way that it may appear to be almost a reality. Otherwise, this very
graphic description will fall flat, and the verdict of your audience will
be that you were not equal to the occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The sky had been overcast all day. All
at once, at this very moment—it was
eight o’clock at night—the clouds in
the horizon broke, and through the elms of
the Nivelles road streamed the sinister red
light of the setting sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Arrangements were speedily made for the
final effort. Each battalion was commanded
by a general. When the tall caps of the
Grenadiers of the Guard with their large
eagle plates appeared, symmetrical, drawn
up in line, calm in the smoke of that conflict,
the enemy felt respect for France. They
thought they saw twenty victories entering
upon the field of battle with wings extended,
and those who were conquerors thinking
themselves conquered recoiled; but Wellington
cried: “Up, Guards, and at them!”</p>

<p>The red regiment of English Guards, lying
behind the hedges, rose up; a shower of
grape riddled the tricolored flag. All hurled
themselves forward, and the final carnage
began. The Imperial Guard felt the army
slipping away around them in the gloom
and the vast overthrow of the rout. There
were no weak souls or cowards there. The
privates of that band were as heroic as their
general. Not a man flinched from the suicide.</p>

<p>The army fell back rapidly from all sides
at once. A disbanding army is a thaw. The
whole bends, cracks, snaps, floats, rolls, falls,
crashes, hurries, plunges. Ney borrows a
horse, leaps upon him, and, without hat,
cravat, or sword, plants himself in the Brussels
road, arresting at once the English and the
French. He endeavors to hold the army;
he calls them back, he reproaches them, he
grapples with the rout. He is swept away.
The soldiers flee from him, crying, “Long
live Ney!” Durutte’s two regiments come
and go, frightened and tossed between the
sabres of the Uhlans and the fire of the brigades
of Kempt. Rout is the worst of all
conflicts; friends slay each other in their
flight; squadrons and battalions are crushed
and dispersed against each other, enormous
foam of the battle.</p>

<p>Napoleon gallops among the fugitives,
harangues them, urges, threatens, entreats.
The mouths which in the morning were crying
“Long live the Emperor,” are now
agape. He is hardly recognized. The Prussian
cavalry, just come up, spring forward,
fling themselves upon the enemy, sabre, cut,
hack, kill, exterminate. Teams rush off; the
guns are left to the care of themselves; the
soldiers of the train unhitch the caissons and
take the horses to escape; wagons upset,
with their four wheels in the air, block up
the road, and are accessories of massacre.</p>

<p>They crush and they crowd; they trample
upon the living and the dead. Arms are
broken. A multitude fills roads, paths
bridges, plains, hills, valleys, woods, choked
up by this flight of forty thousand men. Cries
despair; knapsacks and muskets cast into
the rye; passages forced at the point of
the sword; no more comrades, no more
officers, no more generals; an inexpressible
dismay. Lions become kids. Such was this
flight.</p>

<p>A few squares of the Guard, immovable in
the flow of the rout as rocks in running
water, held out until night. Night approaching
and death also, they awaited this double
shadow, and yielded unfaltering to its embrace.
At every discharge the square grew
less, but returned the fire. It replied to
grape by bullets, narrowing in its four walls
continually. Afar off, the fugitives, stopping
for a moment out of breath, heard in the
darkness this dismal thunder decreasing.</p>

<p>When this legion was reduced to a handful,
when their flag was reduced to a shred,
when their muskets, exhausted of ammunition,
were reduced to nothing but clubs, when
the pile of corpses was larger than the group
of the living, there spread among the conquerors
a sort of sacred terror about these
sublime martyrs, and the English artillery,
stopping to take breath, was silent. It was
a kind of respite. These combatants had
about them a swarm of spectres, the outlines
of men on horseback, the black profile of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
cannons, the white sky seen through the
wheels and gun-carriages. The colossal
death’s head, which heroes always see in the
smoke of the battle, was advancing upon
them and glaring at them.</p>

<p>They could hear in the gloom of the
twilight the loading of the pieces. The
lighted matches, like tigers’ eyes in the
night, made a circle about their heads. All
the linstocks of the English batteries approached
the guns, when, touched by their
heroism, holding the death-moment suspended
over these men, an English general
cried to them:</p>

<p>“Brave Frenchmen, surrender!”</p>

<p>The word “Never!” fierce and desperate
came rolling back.</p>

<p>To this word the English general replied,
“Fire!”</p>

<p>The batteries flamed, the hill trembled;
from all those brazen throats went forth a
final vomiting of grape, terrific. A vast
smoke, dusky white in the light of the rising
moon, rolled out, and when the smoke was
dissipated, there was nothing left. That formidable
remnant was annihilated—the Guard
was dead! The four walls of the living redoubt
had fallen. Hardly could a quivering
be distinguished here and there among the
corpses; and thus the French legions expired.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">A pin is such a tiny thing—of that there is no doubt—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet when it’s sticking in your flesh, you’re wretched till it’s out.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She is wonderfully observing—when she meets a pretty girl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is always sure to tell her if her “bang” is out of curl.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she is so sympathetic to her friend, who’s much admired,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is often heard remarking: “Dear, you look so worn and tired!”</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And she is a careful critic; for on yesterday she eyed</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whenever I encounter her, in such a nameless way,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And the hat that was imported (and that cost me half a sonnet),</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">She is always bright and smiling, sharp and shining for a thrust—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Use does not seem to blunt her point, nor does she gather rust—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“No, at the Arsenal”—“The Bastile!”—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">“Where you will,”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Treading with wearied and supreme disdain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Midst the forms of dead men he perchance had slain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dread is that human storm, an angry crowd:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Like a sunbeam seemed to light the day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A child appeared, a boy with golden hair,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I tell you this is papa.” One girl cried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“A pretty fellow—see his curly head!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“How old are you, my boy?” another said.</div>

<h4>THE BLACK HORSE AND HIS RIDER.</h4>

<p>Slow utterance, rapid utterance, loud tones, subdued tones, quick changes
and intense dramatic force are all required in this reading. Lose
yourself in your recitation. Never be self-conscious.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It was the 7th of October, 1777. Horatio
Gates stood before his tent gazing
steadfastly upon the two armies now
arrayed in order of battle. It was a clear,
bracing day, mellow with the richness of
Autumn. The sky was cloudless; the foliage
of the wood scarce tinged with purple and
gold; the buckwheat in yonder fields frostened
into snowy ripeness. But the tread of
legions shook the ground; from every bush
shot the glimmer of the rifle barrel; on
every hillside blazed the sharpened bayonet.
Gates was sad and thoughtful, as he watched
the evolutions of the two armies.</p>

<p>But all at once, a smoke arose, a thunder
shook the ground, and a chorus of shouts
and groans yelled along the darkened air.
The play of death had begun. The two
flags, this of the stars, that of the red cross,
tossed amid the smoke of battle, while the
sky was clouded with leaden folds, and the
earth throbbed with the pulsations of a
mighty heart. Suddenly, Gates and his officers
were startled. Along the height on
which they stood, came a rider, upon a black
horse, rushing toward the distant battle.</p>

<p>There was something in the appearance of
this horse and his rider, that struck them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
with surprise. Look! he draws his sword,
the sharp blade quivers through the air—he
points to the distant battle, and lo! he is
gone; gone through those clouds, while his
shout echoes over the plains. Wherever the
fight is the thickest, there through intervals
of cannon smoke, you may see riding madly
forward that strange soldier, mounted on his
steed black as death. Look at him, as with
face red with British blood he waves his
sword and shouts to his legions. Now you
may see him fighting in that cannon’s glare,
and the next moment he is away off yonder,
leading the forlorn hope up that steep cliff.</p>

<p>Is it not a magnificent sight, to see that
strange soldier and that noble black horse
dashing like a meteor, down the long columns
of battle? Let us look for a moment
into those dense war-clouds. Over this thick
hedge bursts a band of American militia-men,
their rude farmer coats stained with blood,
while scattering their arms by the way, they
flee before that company of redcoat hirelings,
who come rushing forward, their solid front
of bayonets gleaming in the battle light.</p>

<p>In this moment of their flight, a horse
comes crashing over the plains. The unknown
rider reins his steed back on his
haunches, right in the path of a broad-shouldered
militia-man. “Now, cowards!
advance another step and I’ll strike you to
the heart!” shouts the unknown, extending
a pistol in either hand. “What! are you
Americans, men, and fly before British soldiers?
Back again, and face them once
more, or I myself will ride you down.”</p>

<p>This appeal was not without its effect.
The militia-man turns; his comrades, as if
by one impulse, follow his example. In one
line, but thirty men in all, they confront
thirty sharp bayonets. The British advance.</p>

<p>“Now upon the rebels, charge!” shouts the
red-coat officer. They spring forward at the
same bound. Look! their bayonets almost
touch the muzzles of their rifles. At this
moment the voice of the unknown rider was
heard: “Now let them have it! Fire!” A
sound is heard, a smoke is seen, twenty
Britons are down, some writhing in death,
some crawling along the soil, and some
speechless as stone. The remaining ten start
back. “Club your rifles and charge them
home!” shouts the unknown.</p>

<p>That black horse springs forward, followed
by the militia-men. Then a confused conflict—a
cry for quarter, and a vision of twenty
farmers grouped around the rider of the
black horse, greeting him with cheers. Thus
it was all the day long. Wherever that black
horse and his rider went, there followed
victory. At last, toward the setting of the
sun, the crisis of the conflict came. That
fortress yonder, on Bemiss’ Heights, must be
won, or the American cause is lost! That
cliff is too steep—that death is too certain.
The officers cannot persuade the men to advance.
The Americans have lost the field.
Even Morgan, that iron man among iron
men, leans on his rifle and despairs of the
field.</p>

<p>But look yonder! In this moment when
all is dismay and horror, here crashing on,
comes the black horse and his rider. That
rider bends upon his steed, his frenzied face
covered with sweat and dust and blood; he
lays his hand upon that brave rifleman’s
shoulder, and as though living fire had been
poured into his veins, he seized his rifle and
started toward the rock. And now look!
now hold your breath, as that black steed
crashes up that steep cliff. That steed quivers!
he totters! he falls! No! No! Still
on, still up the cliff, still on toward the fortress.</p>

<p>The rider turns his face and shouts, “Come
on, men of Quebec! come on!” That call
is needless. Already the bold riflemen are
on the rock. Now British cannon pour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
your fires, and lay your dead in tens and
twenties on the rock. Now, red-coat hirelings,
shout your battle-cry if you can! For
look! there, in the gate of the fortress, as
the smoke clears away, stands the Black
Horse and his rider. That steed falls dead,
pierced by an hundred balls; but his rider,
as the British cry for quarter, lifts up his
voice and shouts afar to Horatio Gates waiting
yonder in his tent, “Saratoga is won!”</p>

<p>As that cry goes up to heaven, he falls
with his leg shattered by a cannon ball.
Who was the rider of the black horse? Do
you not guess his name? Then bend down
and gaze on that shattered limb, and you will
see that it bears the marks of a former wound.
That wound was received in the storming of
Quebec. That rider of the Black Horse
was Benedict Arnold.</p>

<h4>CAUGHT IN THE QUICKSAND.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It sometimes happens that a man, traveler
or fisherman, walking on the beach at
low tide, far from the bank, suddenly
notices that for several minutes he has been
walking with some difficulty. The strand
beneath his feet is like pitch; his soles stick
in it; it is sand no longer; it is glue.</p>

<p>The beach is perfectly dry, but at every
step he takes, as soon as he lift his foot, the
print which it leaves fills with water. The
eye, however, has noticed no change; the
immense strand is smooth and tranquil; all
the sand has the same appearance; nothing
distinguishes the surface which is solid from
that which is no longer so; the joyous little
crowd of sandflies continue to leap tumultuously
over the wayfarer’s feet. The man
pursues his way, goes forward, inclines to the
land, endeavors to get nearer the upland.</p>

<p>He is not anxious. Anxious about what?
Only he feels, somehow, as if the weight of
his feet increases with every step he takes.
Suddenly he sinks in.</p>

<p>He sinks in two or three inches. Decidedly
he is not on the right road; he stops to
take his bearings; now he looks at his feet.
They have disappeared. The sand covers
them. He draws them out of the sand; he
will retrace his steps. He turns back, he
sinks in deeper. The sand comes up to his
ankles; he pulls himself out and throws himself
to the left; the sand half leg deep. He
throws himself to the right; the sand comes
up to his shins.</p>

<p>Then he recognizes with unspeakable terror
that he is caught in the quicksand, and
that he has beneath him the terrible medium
in which man can no more walk than the fish
can swim. He throws off his load, if he has
one, lightens himself as a ship in distress; it
is already too late; the sand is above his
knees. He calls, he waves his hat or his
handkerchief; the sand gains on him more
and more. If the beach is deserted, if the
land is too far off, if there is no help in sight,
it is all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>He is condemned to that appalling burial,
long, infallible, implacable and impossible to
slacken or to hasten, which endures for hours,
which seizes you erect, free and in full health,
and which draws you by the feet; which, at
every effort that you attempt, at every shout
you utter, drags you a little deeper, sinking
you slowly into the earth while you look
upon the horizon, the sails of the ships upon
the sea, the birds flying and singing, the sunshine
and the sky. The victim attempts to
sit down, to lie down, to creep; every movement
he makes inters him; he straightens
up, he sinks in; he feels that he is being
swallowed. He howls, implores, cries to the
clouds, despairs.</p>

<p>Behold him waist deep in the sand. The
sand reaches his breast; he is now only a
bust. He raises his arms, utters furious
groans, clutches the beach with his nails,
would hold by that straw, leans upon his
elbows, to pull himself out of this soft sheath;
sobs frenziedly; the sand rises; the sand
reaches his shoulders; the sand reaches his
neck; the face alone is visible now.</p>

<p>The mouth cries, the sand fills it—silence.
The eyes still gaze—the sand shuts them;
night. Now the forehead decreases, a little
hair flutters above the sand; a hand come to
the surface of the beach, moves, and shakes,
disappears. It is the earth-drowning man.
The earth filled with the ocean becomes a
trap. It presents itself like a plain, and opens
like a wave.</p>

<h4>THE LITTLE QUAKER SINNER.</h4>

    <div class="dropcapline">A little Quaker maiden, with dimpled cheek and chin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before an ancient mirror stood, and viewed her from within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She wore a gown of sober gray, a cap demure and prim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With only simple fold and hem, yet dainty, neat and trim.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her bonnet, too, was gray and stiff; its only line of grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was in the lace, so soft and white, shirred round her rosy face.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quoth she: “Oh, how I hate this hat! I hate this gown and cape!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I do wish all my clothes were not of such outlandish shape!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The children passing by to school have ribbons on their hair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The little girl next door wears blue; oh, dear, if I could dare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know what I should like to do!”—(The words were whispered low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest such tremendous heresy should reach her aunts below.)</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">All their prudent, humble teaching willfully she cast aside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, her mind now fully conquered by vanity and pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She, with trembling heart and fingers, on a hassock sat her down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this little Quaker sinner sewed a tuck into her gown!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Mercy Jones and Goodman Elder with his wife have left their home.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas Aunt Faith’s sweet voice that called her, and the naughty little maid—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gliding down the dark old stairway—hoped their notice to evade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keeping shyly in their shadow as they went out at the door,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But “tuck—tuck!” chirped the sparrows, at the little maiden’s side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, in passing Farmer Watson’s, where the barn-door opened wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every sound that issued from it, every grunt and every cluck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was to her affrighted fancy like “a tuck!” “a tuck!” “a tuck!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In meeting, Goodman Elder spoke of pride and vanity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While all the Friends seemed looking round that dreadful tuck to see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How it swelled in its proportions, till it seemed to fill the air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the heart of little Patience grew heavier with her care.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O, the glad relief to her, when, prayers and exhortations ended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behind her two good aunties her homeward way she wended!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The pomps and vanities of life she’d seized with eager arms,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, to the dregs had drained them, and only this to find:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All was vanity of spirit and vexation of the mind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, repentant, saddened, humbled on her hassock she sat down,</div>

<h4>THE TELL-TALE HEART.</h4>

<p>The emotions of horror and dismay are vividly brought out in this
selection, which is characteristic of some of the writings of Edgar A.
Poe. He had a morbid fancy for the weird, the gruesome and startling, all
of which appear in this ghastly description from his pen. The piece is
an excellent one of its kind. It requires the ability of a tragedian to
properly deliver it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">With a loud yell I threw open the
lantern and leaped into the room.
He shrieked once—once only. In
an instant I dragged him to the floor, and
pulled the heavy bed over him. I then
smiled gayly to find the deed so far done.
But for many minutes the heart beat on with
a muffled sound. This, however, did not
vex me; it would not be heard through the
wall. At length it ceased. The old man
was dead. I removed the bed and examined
the corpse. I placed my hand upon the
heart and held it there many minutes. There
was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His
eye would trouble me no more.</p>

<p>If you still think me mad, you will think
so no longer when I describe the wise precautions
I took for the concealment of the
body. The night waned, and I worked hastily,
but in silence. First of all I dismembered
the corpse.</p>

<p>I then took up three planks from the
flooring of the chamber and deposited all
between the scantlings. I then replaced the
boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no
human eye—not even his—could have detected
anything wrong.</p>

<p>When I had made an end of these labors
it was four o’clock—still dark as midnight.
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a
knocking at the street door. I went down
to open it with a light heart—for what had
I now to fear? Then entered three men
who introduced themselves, with perfect
suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek
had been heard by a neighbor during the
night; suspicion of foul play had been
aroused; information had been lodged at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
police office, and they (the officers) had been
deputed to search the premises.</p>

<p>I smiled—for what had I to fear? I bade
the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said,
was my own in a dream. The old man, I
mentioned, was absent in the country. I
took my visitors all over the house. I bade
them search—search well. I led them at
length to his chamber. I showed them his
treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm
of my confidence I brought chairs
into the room, and desired them here to rest
from their fatigues, while I myself, in the
wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed
my own seat upon the very spot beneath
which reposed the corpse of the victim.</p>

<p>The officers were satisfied. My manner
had convinced them. I was singularly at
ease. But ere long I felt myself getting pale
and wished them gone. My head ached,
and I fancied a ringing in my ears; but still
they sat and still chatted. The ringing became
more distinct; it continued and gained
definitiveness—until at length I found that
the noise was not within my ears.</p>

<p>No doubt I now grew very pale; but I
talked more fluently and with a heightened
voice. Yet the sound increased—and what
could I do. It was a low, dull, quick sound—much
such a sound as a watch makes
when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for
breath—and yet the officers heard it not. I
talked more quickly—more vehemently; but
the noise steadily increased. I arose and
argued about trifles, in a high key and with
violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily
increased. Why would they not be gone? I
paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides,
as if excited to fury by the observations of the
men—but the noise steadily increased. O
God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I
swore! I swung the chair upon which I had
been sitting, and grated it upon the boards,
but the noise arose over all and continually
increased. It grew louder—louder—louder.
And still the men chatted pleasantly and
smiled. Was it possible they heard not?</p>

<p>They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they
were making a mockery of my horror!
this I thought, and this I think. But
anything was better than this agony! Anything
was more tolerable than this derision!
I can bear those hypocritical smiles no
longer! I felt that I must scream or die!—and
now—again!—hark! louder! louder!
louder! louder!</p>

<p>“Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no
more! I admit the deed—tear up the planks!
here! here! it is the beating of his hideous
heart!”</p>

<h4>THE LITTLE MATCH-GIRL.</h4>

<p class="center">A CHRISTMAS STORY.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It was terribly cold; it snowed and was
already almost dark and evening coming
on—the last evening of the year.
In the cold and gloom a little girl, bareheaded
and barefooted, was walking through the
streets. When she left her own house she
certainly had slippers on, slippers, but of
what use were they? They were very big
slippers, and her mother had used them until
then. So big were they the little maid lost
them as she slipped across the road, where
two carriages were rattling by terribly fast.
One slipper was not to be found again, and
a boy had seized the other and ran away
with it. So now the little girl went with
naked feet, which were quite red and blue
with the cold. In an old apron she carried
a number of matches and a bundle of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
in her hand. No one had bought anything
of her all day, and no one had given her a
farthing.</p>

<p>Shivering with cold and hunger she crept
along, a picture of misery, poor little girl!
The snowflakes covered her long, fair hair,
which fell in pretty curls over her neck, but
she did not think of that now. In all the
windows lights were shining and there was a
glorious smell of roast goose, for it was
Christmas Eve. Yes, she thought of that!</p>

<p>In a corner formed by two houses, one of
which projected beyond the other, she sat
down, cowering. She had drawn up her
little feet, but she was still colder, and she
did not dare go home, for she had sold no
matches, and did not therefore have a farthing
of money. From her father she would
certainly receive a beating, and, besides, it
was cold at home, for they had nothing over
them but a roof, through which the wind
whistled, though the largest rents had been
stopped with straw and rags.</p>

<p>Her hands were almost benumbed with
the cold. Ah! a match might do her good
if she could only draw one from the bundle
and rub it against the wall and warm her
hands at it. She draws one out. R-r-atch!
How it sputtered and burned! It was a
warm, bright flame, like a candle, when she
held her hands over it; it was a wonderful
little light! It really seemed to the child as
if she sat before a great polished stove with
bright brass feet and a brass cover. How
the fire burned! How comfortable it was!
but the little flame went out, the stove vanished,
and she had only the remains of the
burnt match in her hand.</p>

<p>A second one was rubbed against the wall.
It burned up, and when the light fell upon
the wall it became transparent, like a thin
veil, and she could see through it into the
room. On the table a snow-white cloth was
spread; upon it stood a shining dinner service;
the roast goose smoked gloriously,
stuffed with apples and dried plums. And
what was still more splendid to behold, the
goose hopped down from the dish and waddled
along the floor, with a knife and fork in
its breast, to the little girl.</p>

<p>Then the match went out, and only the
thick, damp, cold wall was before her. She
lighted another match. Then she was sitting
under a beautiful Christmas tree; it was
greater and more ornamented than the one
she had seen through the glass door at the rich
merchant’s. Thousands of candles burned
upon its green branches and lighted up the
pictures in the room. The girl stretched
forth her hand toward them; then the match
went out. The Christmas lights mounted
higher. She saw them now as stars in the
sky; one of them fell down, forming a long
line of fire.</p>

<p>“Now some one is dying,” thought the
little girl, for her old grandmother, the only
person who had loved her and who was now
dead, had told her that when a star fell down
a soul mounted up to God.</p>

<p>She rubbed another match against the
wall; it became bright again, and in the
brightness the old grandmother stood clear
and shining, mild and lovely.</p>

<p>“Grandmother!” cried the child, “oh!
take me with you! I know you will go
when the match is burned out. You will
vanish like the warm fire, the warm food,
and the great, glorious Christmas tree!”</p>

<p>And she hastily rubbed the whole bundle
of matches, for she wished to hold her grandmother
fast. And the matches burned with
such a glow that it became brighter than in
the middle of the day; grandmother had
never been so large or so beautiful. She
took the child in her arms and both flew in
brightness and joy above the earth, very,
very high; and up there was neither cold
nor hunger nor care—they were with God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>But in the corner, leaning against the wall,
sat the poor girl with red cheeks and smiling
mouth, frozen to death. “She wanted to
warm herself,” the people said. No one
imagined what a beautiful thing she had
seen and in what glory she had gone in
with her grandmother on that Christmas
night.</p>

    <div class="dropcapline">I read a legend of a monk who painted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In an old convent cell in days bygone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pictures of martyrs and of virgins sainted,</div>

<h4>THE BOAT RACE</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Algonquins rowed up and down a
few times before the spectators. They
appeared in perfect training, mettlesome
as colts, steady as draught horses, deep
breathed as oxen, disciplined to work together
as symmetrically as a single sculler
pulls his pair of oars.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, and all eyes were
strained to the south, looking for the Atalanta.
A clumb of trees hid the edge of the
lake along which the Corinna’s boat was
stealing toward the starting point. Presently
the long shell swept into view, with its
blooming rowers. How steadily the Atalanta
came on! No rocking, no splashing,
no apparent strain; the bow oar turning to
look ahead every now and then, and watching
her course, which seemed to be straight
as an arrow, the beat of the strokes as true
and regular as the pulse of the healthiest
rower among them all.</p>

<p>If the sight of the other boat and its crew
of young men was beautiful, how lovely was
the look of this: eight young girls—all in
the flush of youth, all in vigorous health;
every muscle taught its duty; each rower
alert not to be a tenth of a second out of
time, or let her oar dally with the water so
as to lose an ounce of its propelling virtue;
every eye kindling with the hope of victory.
Each of the boats was cheered as it came in
sight, but the cheers for the Atalanta were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
naturally the loudest, as the gallantry of one
sex and the clear, high voices of the other
gave it his and vigor.</p>

<p>“Take your places!” shouted the umpire,
five minutes before the half-hour. The two
boats felt their way slowly and cautiously to
their positions. After a little backing and
filling they got into line, and sat motionless,
the bodies of the rowers bent forward, their
arms outstretched, their oars in the water,
waiting for the word. “Go!” shouted the
umpire. Away sprang the Atalanta, and far
behind her leaped the Algonquin, her oars
bending like long Indian bows as their blades
flashed through the water.</p>

<p>“A stern chase is a long chase,” especially
when one craft is a great distance behind the
other. It looked as if it would be impossible
for the rear boat to overcome the odds against
it. Of course, the Algonquin kept gaining,
but could it possibly gain enough? As the
boats got farther and farther away, it became
difficult to determine what change there was
in the interval between them.</p>

<p>But when they came to rounding the stake
it was easier to guess at the amount of space
which had been gained. Something like half
the distance—four lengths as nearly as could
be estimated—had been made up in rowing
the first three-quarters of a mile. Could the
Algonquins do a little better than this in the
second half of the race-course they would be
sure of winning.</p>

<p>The boats had turned the stake and were
coming in rapidly. Every minute the University
boat was getting nearer the other.</p>

<p>“Go it, ’Quins!” shouted the students.</p>

<p>“Pull away, ’Lantas!” screamed the girls,
who were crowding down to the edge of the
water.</p>

<p>Nearer, nearer—the rear boat is pressing
the other more and more closely—a few
more strokes and they will be even. It looks
desperate for the Atalantas. The bow oar of
the Algonquin turns his head. He sees the
little coxswain leaning forward at every
stroke, as if her trivial weight were of such
mighty consequence—but a few ounces might
turn the scale of victory. As he turned he
got a glimpse of the stroke oar of the Atalanta;
what a flash of loveliness it was!
Her face was like the reddest of June roses,
with the heat and the strain and passion of
expected triumph.</p>

<p>The upper button of her close-fitting flannel
suit had strangled her as her bosom
heaved with exertion, and it had given way
before the fierce clutch she made at it. The
bow oar was a staunch and steady rower,
but he was human. The blade of his oar
lingered in the water; a little more and he
would have caught a crab, and perhaps lost
the race by his momentary bewilderment.</p>

<p>The boat, which seemed as if it had all the
life and nervousness of a three-year-old colt,
felt the slight check, and all her men bent
more vigorously to their oars. The Atalanta
saw the movement, and made a spurt to keep
their lead and gain upon it if they could. It
was no use. The strong arms of the young
men were too much for the young maidens;
only a few lengths remained to be rowed, and
they would certainly pass the Atalanta before
she could reach the line.</p>

<p>The little coxswain saw that it was all up
with the girls’ crew if she could not save
them by some strategic device. As she
stooped she lifted the handkerchief at her
feet and took from it a flaming bouquet.
“Look!” she cried, and flung it just forward
of the track of the Algonquin.</p>

<p>The captain of the University boat turned
his head, and there was the lovely vision
which had, a moment before, bewitched him.
The owner of all that loveliness must, he
thought, have flung the bouquet. It was a
challenge; how could he be such a coward
as to decline accepting it? He was sure he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
could win the race now, and he would sweep
past the line in triumph with the great bunch
of flowers at the stern of his boat, proud as
Van Tromp in the British Channel with the
broom at his masthead.</p>

<p>He turned the boat’s head a little by backing
water, and came up with the floating
flowers, near enough to reach them. He
stooped and snatched them up, with the loss
perhaps of a second, no more. He felt sure
of his victory.</p>

<p>The bow of the Algonquin passes the
stern of the Atalanta! The bow of the Algonquin
is on a level with the middle of the
Atalanta—three more lengths and the college
crew will pass the girls!</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the ’Quins!” The Algonquin
ranges up alongside of the Atalanta!</p>

<p>“Through with her!” shouts the captain
of the Algonquin.</p>

<p>“Now, girls!” shrieks the captain of the
Atalanta.</p>

<p>They near the line, every rower straining
desperately, almost madly. Crack goes the
oar of the Atalanta’s captain, and up flash its
splintered fragments as the stem of her boat
springs past the line, eighteen inches at least
ahead of the Algonquin.</p>

<p>“Hooraw for the ’Lantas! Hooraw for
the girls! Hooraw for the Institoot!” shout
a hundred voices.</p>

<p>And there is loud laughing and cheering
all round.</p>

<p>The pretty little captain had not studied
her classical dictionary for nothing. “I
have paid off an old ‘score,’” she said. “Set
down my damask roses against the golden
apples of Hippomenes!” It was that one
second lost in snatching up the bouquet
which gave the race to the Atalantas!</p>

<p>An oration, strictly speaking, is an elaborate
discourse delivered on some special
occasion, and in a somewhat formal and dignified
manner. As this class of recitations
stands by itself and is quite different from
the other selections contained in this volume,
I have grouped together here a number of
Famous Orations, all of which have given
their authors celebrity. These are well
suited for public delivery by those who prefer
this kind of recitation and have the oratorical
ability required for reciting them.</p>

<h4>TRUE MORAL COURAGE.</h4>

<p class="center">BY HENRY CLAY.</p>

<p>When reference is made to America’s greatest orators it is customary to
mention the name of Henry Clay among the very first. He was frequently
called “The Mill Boy of the Slashes,” from the fact that he was a poor
boy and was born in a district in Virginia called “the Slashes.” Mr. Clay
was tall and slender and had a voice of wonderful range and sympathy, was
remarkably easy and graceful in manner, and few orators who ever lived
possessed such persuasive power.</p>

<p>The opening part of this fine selection should be delivered in a rather
quiet, slightly satirical tone; but in the later passages the speaker
should grow warm and enthusiastic, and voice and gesture should express a
full appreciation of the lofty sentiments he is uttering.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There is a sort of courage, which, I
frankly confess it, I do not possess—a
boldness to which I dare not aspire,
a valor which I cannot covet. I cannot lay
myself down in the way of the welfare and
happiness of my country. That, I cannot—I
have not the courage to do. I cannot interpose
the power with which I may be invested—a
power conferred, not for my personal
benefit, nor for my aggrandizement,
but for my country’s good—to check her
onward march to greatness and glory. I
have not courage enough. I am too cowardly
for that.</p>

<p>I would not, I dare not, in the exercise of
such a threat, lie down, and place my body
across the path that leads my country to
prosperity and happiness. This is a sort of
courage widely different from that which a
man may display in his private conduct and
personal relations. Personal or private courage
is totally distinct from that higher and
nobler courage which prompts the patriot to
offer himself a voluntary sacrifice to his
country’s good.</p>

<p>Apprehensions of the imputation of the
want of firmness sometimes impel us to perform
rash and inconsiderate acts. It is the
greatest courage to be able to bear the imputation
of the want of courage.</p>

<p>But pride, vanity, egotism, so unamiable
and offensive in private life, are vices which
partake of the character of crimes in the
conduct of public affairs. The unfortunate
victim of these passions cannot see beyond
the little, petty, contemptible circle of his
own personal interests. All his thoughts are
withdrawn from his country, and concentrated
on his consistency, his firmness, himself.</p>

<p>The high, the exalted, the sublime emotions
of a patriotism which, soaring toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
heaven, rises far above all mean, low, or
selfish things, and is absorbed by one soul-transporting
thought of the good and the
glory of one’s country, are never felt in his
impenetrable bosom. That patriotism which,
catching its inspiration of the immortal God,
and, leaving at an immeasurable distance below
all lesser, groveling, personal interests
and feelings, animates and prompts to deeds
of self-sacrifice, of valor, of devotion, and of
death itself—that is public virtue; that is the
noblest, the sublimest of all public virtues!</p>

<h4>THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY.</h4>

<p class="center">BY JOSIAH QUINCY.</p>

<p>An American orator and patriot, born in Massachusetts in 1744, Mr.
Quincy, by his fervid and convincing eloquence, was one of the most
powerful champions of the popular cause of independence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Be not deceived, my countrymen.
Believe not these venal hirelings,
when they would cajole you by
their subtleties into submission, or
frighten you by their vaporings into compliance.
When they strive to flatter you by
the terms “moderation and prudence,” tell
them that calmness and deliberation are to
guide the judgment; courage and intrepidity
command the action. When they endeavor
to make us “perceive our inability to oppose
our mother country,” let us boldly answer—In
defence of our civil and religious rights,
we dare oppose the world; with the God of
armies on our side, even the God who fought
our fathers’ battles, we fear not the hour of
trial, though the hosts of our enemies should
cover the field like locusts. If this be enthusiasm,
we will live and die enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Blandishments will not fascinate us, nor
will threats of a “halter” intimidate. For,
under God, we are determined, that wheresoever,
whensoever, or howsoever we shall be
called to make our exit, we will die freemen.
Well do we know that all the regalia of this
world can not dignify the death of a villain,
nor diminish the ignominy with which a
slave shall quit existence.</p>

<p>Neither can it taint the unblemished honor
of a son of freedom though he should make
his departure on the already prepared gibbet,
or be dragged to the newly-erected scaffold
for execution. With the plaudits of his country,
and what is more, the plaudits of his conscience,
he will go off the stage. The history
of his life, his children shall venerate. The virtues
of their sires shall excite their emulation.</p>

<p>Is the debt we owe posterity paid? Answer
me, thou coward, who hidest thyself in
the hour of trial! If there is no reward in
this life, no prize of glory in the next, capable
of animating thy dastard soul, think and
tremble, thou miscreant! at the whips and
stripes thy master shall lash thee with on earth—and
the flames and scorpions thy second
master shall torment thee with hereafter!</p>

<p>Oh my countrymen! what will our children
say, when they read the history of these
times, should they find that we tamely gave
way, without one noble struggle for the most
invaluable of earthly blessings! As they
drag the galling chain, will they not execrate
us? If we have any respect for things
sacred, any regard to the dearest treasure on
earth; if we have one tender sentiment for
posterity; if we would not be despised by
the world; let us, in the most open, solemn
manner, and with determined fortitude, swear—we
will die if we cannot live freemen. While
we have equity, justice, and God on our side,
tyranny, spiritual or temporal, shall never ride
triumphant in a land inhabited by Englishmen.</p>

<h4>CENTENNIAL ORATION.</h4>

<p class="center">BY HENRY ARMITT BROWN.</p>

<p>From the oration delivered upon the occasion of the Centennial
Anniversary of the meeting of the first Colonial Congress in Carpenters’
Hall, Philadelphia. This oration is the masterpiece of a young orator
who died when but little past the age of thirty, having already gained a
wide celebrity for scholarly attainments and commanding eloquence. It is
remarkable for boldness of thought and fervor of expression.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The conditions of life are always changing,
and the experience of the fathers
is rarely the experience of the sons.
The temptations which are trying us are not
the temptations which beset their footsteps,
nor the dangers which threaten our pathway
the dangers which surrounded them. These
men were few in number; we are many.
They were poor, but we are rich. They were
weak, but we are strong. What is it, countrymen,
that we need to-day? Wealth? Behold
it in your hands. Power? God hath
given it you. Liberty? It is your birthright.
Peace? It dwells amongst you.</p>

<p>You have a Government founded in the
hearts of men, built by the people for the
common good. You have a land flowing
with milk and honey; your homes are happy,
your workshops busy, your barns are full.
The school, the railway, the telegraph, the
printing press, have welded you together into
one. Descend those mines that honeycomb
the hills! Behold that commerce whitening
every sea! Stand by your gates and see that
multitude pour through them from the corners
of the earth, grafting the qualities of
older stocks upon one stem; mingling the
blood of many races in a common stream,
and swelling the rich volume of our English
speech with varied music from an hundred
tongues.</p>

<p>You have a long and glorious history, a
past glittering with heroic deeds, an ancestry
full of lofty and imperishable examples. You
have passed through danger, endured privation,
been acquainted with sorrow, been tried
by suffering. You have journeyed in safety
through the wilderness and crossed in triumph
the Red Sea of civil strife, and the
foot of Him who led you hath not faltered
nor the light of His countenance been turned
away.</p>

<p>It is a question for us now, not of the
founding of a new government, but of the
preservation of one already old; not of the
formation of an independent power, but of
the purification of a nation’s life; not of the
conquest of a foreign foe, but of the subjection
of ourselves. The capacity of man to
rule himself is to be proven in the days to
come, not by the greatness of his wealth;
not by his valor in the field; not by the extent
of his dominion, nor by the splendor of
his genius.</p>

<p>The dangers of to-day come from within.
The worship of self, the love of power, the
lust for gold, the weakening of faith, the decay
of public virtue, the lack of private worth—these
are the perils which threaten our
future; these are the enemies we have to
fear; these are the traitors which infest the
camp; and the danger was far less when
Catiline knocked with his army at the gates
of Rome, than when he sat smiling in the
Senate House. We see them daily face to
face; in the walk of virtue; in the road to
wealth; in the path to honor; on the way to
happiness. There is no peace between them
and our safety. Nor can we avoid them and
turn back. It is not enough to rest upon the
past. No man or nation can stand still. We
must mount upward or go down. We must
grow worse or better. It is the Eternal
Law—we cannot change it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>My countrymen: this anniversary has gone
by forever, and my task is done. While I
have spoken, the hour has passed from us;
the hand has moved upon the dial, and the
old century is dead. The American Union
hath endured an hundred years! Here, on
this threshold of the future, the voice of
humanity shall not plead to us in vain.
There shall be darkness in the days to come;
danger for our courage; temptation for our
virtue; doubt for our faith; suffering for
our fortitude. A thousand shall fall before
us, and tens of thousands at our right
hand. The years shall pass beneath our
feet, and century follow century in quick
succession. The generations of men shall
come and go; the greatness of yesterday
shall be forgotten; to-day and the glories of
this noon shall vanish before to-morrow’s
sun; but America shall not perish, but endure
while the spirit of our fathers animates their
sons.</p>

<h4>SPEECH OF SHREWSBURY BEFORE QUEEN ELIZABETH.</h4>

<p class="center">BY FREDERIC VON SCHILLER.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">God whose most wondrous hand has
four times protected you, and who
to-day gave the feeble arm of gray
hairs strength to turn aside the stroke of a
madman, should inspire confidence. I will not
now speak in the name of justice: this is not
the time. In such a tumult, you cannot
hear her still small voice. Consider this
only: you are fearful now of the living Mary;
but I say it is not the living you have to
fear. <i>Tremble at the dead—the beheaded.</i>
She will rise from the grave a fiend of dissension.
She will awaken the spirit of revenge
in your kingdom, and wean the hearts
of your subjects from you. At present she
is an object of dread to the British; but
when she is no more, they will revenge her.</p>

<p>No longer will she then be regarded as
the enemy of their faith; her mournful fate
will cause her to appear as the grand-daughter
of their king, the victim of man’s hatred,
and woman’s jealousy. Soon will you see
the change appear! Drive through London
after the bloody deed has been done; show
yourself to the people, who now surround
you with joyful acclamations: then will you
see another England, another people! No
longer will you then walk forth encircled by
the radiance of heavenly justice which now
binds every heart to you. Dread the frightful
name of tyrant which will precede you
through shuddering hearts, and resound
through every street where you pass. You
have done the last irrevocable deed. What
head stands fast when this sacred one has
fallen?</p>

<h4>THE PROSPECTS OF THE REPUBLIC.</h4>

<p class="center">BY EDWARD EVERETT.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">This, then, is the theatre on which the
intellect of America is to appear, and
such the motives to its exertion, such
the mass to be influenced by its energies,
such the crowd to witness its efforts, such the
glory to crown its success. If I err in this
happy vision of my country’s fortunes, I
thank God for an error so animating. If this
be false may I never know the truth. Never
may you, my friends, be under any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
feeling than that a great, a growing, an immeasurably
expanding country is calling upon
you for your best services.</p>

<p>The most powerful motives call on us
for those efforts which our common country
demands of all her children. Most of
us are of that class who owe whatever of
knowledge has shone into our minds, to
the free and popular institutions of our
native land. There are few of us, who may
not be permitted to boast, that we have
been reared in an honest poverty or a frugal
competence, and owe everything to those
means of education which are equally open
to all.</p>

<p>We are summoned to new energy and zeal
by the high nature of the experiment we are
appointed in Providence to make, and the
grandeur of the theatre on which it is to be
performed. When the Old World afforded
no longer any hope, it pleased Heaven to
open this last refuge of humanity. The attempt
has begun, and is going on, far from
foreign corruption, on the broadest scale, and
under the most benignant prospects; and it
certainly rests with us to solve the great
problem in human society, to settle, and that
forever, that momentous question—whether
mankind can be trusted with a purely popular
system?</p>

<p>One might almost think, without extravagance,
that the departed wise and good of all
places and times are looking down from their
happy seats to witness what shall now be
done by us; that they who lavished their
treasures and their blood of old, who labored
and suffered, who spake and wrote, who
fought and perished, in the one great cause
of freedom and truth, are now hanging from
their orbs on high, over the last solemn experiment
of humanity.</p>

<p>As I have wandered over the spots, once
the scene of their labors, and mused among
the prostrate columns of their senate houses
and forums, I have seemed almost to hear a
voice from the tombs of departed ages; from
the sepulchers of the nations, which died before
the sight. They exhort us, they adjure
us, to be faithful to our trust.</p>

<p>They implore us, by the long trials of
struggling humanity, by the blessed memory
of the departed; by the dear faith, which has
been plighted by pure hands, to the holy
cause of truth and man; by the awful secrets
of the prison houses, where the sons of freedom
have been immured; by the noble heads
which have been brought to the block; by
the wrecks of time, by the eloquent ruins of
nations, they conjure us not to quench the
light which is rising on the world. Greece
cries to us, by the convulsed lips of her poisoned,
dying Demosthenes; and Rome pleads
with us, in the mute persuasion of her mangled
Tully.</p>

<h4>THE PEOPLE ALWAYS CONQUER.</h4>

<p class="center">BY EDWARD EVERETT.</p>

<p>As a finished scholar and eloquent speaker, Mr. Everett gained the
highest distinction. His silvery tones and flowery periods held
multitudes spellbound. His orations were always prepared with the
greatest care, delivered from memory, and are models of elevated thought
and sentiment and brilliant diction. He was the finished orator, noted
for the classic beauty of his writings.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Sir, in the efforts of the people—of
the people struggling for their
rights—moving, not in organized,
disciplined masses, but in their spontaneous
action, man for man, and heart for heart—there
is something glorious. They can then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
move forward without orders, act together
without combination, and brave the flaming
lines of battle without entrenchments to
cover or walls to shield them.</p>

<p>No dissolute camp has worn off from the
feelings of the youthful soldier the freshness
of that home, where his mother and his sisters
sit waiting, with tearful eyes and aching
hearts, to hear good news from the wars; no
long service in the ranks of a conqueror has
turned the veteran’s heart into marble.
Their valor springs not from recklessness,
from habit, from indifference to the preservation
of a life knit by no pledges to the life of
others; but in the strength and spirit of the
cause alone, they act, they contend, they
bleed. In this they conquer.</p>

<p>The people always conquer. They always
<i>must</i> conquer. Armies may be defeated,
kings may be overthrown, and new dynasties
imposed, by foreign arms, on an ignorant
and slavish race, that cares not in what
language the covenant of their subjection
runs, nor in whose name the deed of their
barter and sale is made out.</p>

<p>But the people never invade; and, when
they rise against the invader, are never subdued.
If they are driven from the plains,
they fly to the mountains. Steep rocks and
everlasting hills are their castles; the tangled,
pathless thicket their palisado; and nature,
God, is their ally! Now he overwhelms the
hosts of their enemies beneath his drifting
mountains of sand; now he buries them beneath
a falling atmosphere of polar snows;
He lets loose his tempest on their fleets;
He puts a folly into their counsels, a madness
into the hearts of their leaders; He
never gave, and never will give, a final triumph
over a virtuous and gallant people, resolved
to be free.</p>

<h4>TO THE SURVIVORS OF BUNKER HILL.</h4>

<p class="center">BY DANIEL WEBSTER.</p>

<p>One of the towering names in American statesmanship is that of Daniel
Webster, “the great defender of the Constitution.” Mr. Webster was
not more remarkable for intellectual power than he was for masterly
eloquence. His triumphs in Senatorial debate and on great public
occasions are historic. In person he was large and brawny, with a
swarthy complexion, massive head, and always conveyed the impression of
strength, and, at times, even of majesty. His orations are masterpieces
of patriotic fervor and scholarly culture.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">Venerable men: you have come
down to us from a former generation.
Heaven has bounteously lengthened
out your lives that you might behold this
joyous day. You are now where you stood
fifty years ago, this very hour, with your
brothers and your neighbors, shoulder to
shoulder, in the strife of your country. Behold
how altered! The same heavens are
indeed over your heads; the same ocean
rolls at your feet; but all else, how changed!
You hear now no roar of hostile cannon, you
see no mixed volumes of smoke and flame
rising from burning Charlestown.</p>

<p>The ground strewed with the dead and
the dying; the impetuous charge; the steady
and successful repulse; the loud call to repeated
assault; the summoning of all that is
manly to repeated resistance; a thousand
bosoms freely and fearlessly bared in an instant
to whatever of terror there may be in
war and death;—all these you have witnessed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
but you witness them no more. All
is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis,
its towers and roofs, which you then saw
filled with wives and children and countrymen
in distress and terror, and looking with
unutterable emotions for the issue of the
combat, have presented you to-day with the
sight of its whole happy population, come
out to welcome and greet you with a universal
jubilee.</p>

<p>Yonder proud ships, by a felicity of position
appropriately lying at the foot of this
mount, and seeming fondly to cling around
it, are not means of annoyance to you, but
your country’s own means of distinction and
defence. All is peace; and God has granted
you this sight of your country’s happiness,
ere you slumber in the grave for ever. He
has allowed you to behold and partake the
reward of your patriotic toils; and he has
allowed us, your sons and countrymen, to
meet you here, and in the name of the present
generation, in the name of your country,
in the name of liberty, to thank you!</p>

<p>But, alas! you are not all here! Time and
the sword have thinned your ranks. Prescott,
Putnam, Stark, Brooks, Read, Pomeroy,
Bridge! our eyes seek for you in vain amidst
this broken band. You are gathered to your
fathers, and live only to your country in her
grateful remembrance and your own bright
example. But let us not too much grieve
that you have met the common fate of men.
You lived at least long enough to know that
your work had been nobly and successfully
accomplished. You lived to see your country’s
independence established and to sheathe
your swords from war. On the light of liberty
you saw arise the light of Peace, like</p>

<h4>SOUTH CAROLINA AND MASSACHUSETTS.</h4>

<p class="center">BY DANIEL WEBSTER.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />

<p class="dropcap">The eulogium pronounced on the character
of the State of South Carolina
by the honorable gentleman, for her
revolutionary and other merits, meets my
hearty concurrence. I shall not acknowledge
that the honorable member goes before me
in regard for whatever of distinguished talent,
or distinguished character, South Carolina
has produced. I claim part of the honor;
I partake in the pride of her great names. I
claim them for countrymen, one and all. The
Laurenses, Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the
Sumters, the Marions—Americans all—whose
fame is no more to be hemmed in by
state lines, than their talents and patriotism
were capable of being circumscribed within
the same narrow limits.</p>

<p>In their day and generation, they served
and honored the country, the whole country,
and their renown is of the treasures of the
whole country. Him whose honored name
the gentleman bears himself—does he suppose
me less capable of gratitude for his patriotism,
or sympathy for his sufferings, than
if his eyes had first opened upon the light in
Massachusetts instead of South Carolina?
Sir, does he suppose it in his power to exhibit
a Carolina name so bright as to produce
envy in my bosom? No, sir—increased
gratification and delight, rather. Sir, I thank
God, that if I am gifted with little of the spirit
which is said to be able to raise mortals to
the skies, I have yet none, as I trust, of that
other spirit which would drag angels down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>When I shall be found, sir, in my place
here in the Senate, or elsewhere, to sneer at
public merit, because it happened to spring
up beyond the limits of my own State and
neighborhood; when I refuse, for any such
cause, or for any cause, the homage due to
American talent, to elevated patriotism, to
sincere devotion to liberty and the country;
or if I see an uncommon endowment of
heaven—if I see extraordinary capacity and
virtue in any son of the South—and if, moved
by local prejudice, or gangrened by State
jealousy, I get up here to abate the tithe of a
hair, from his just character and just fame,
may my tongue cleave to the roof of my
mouth!</p>

<p>I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts—she
needs none. There she is—behold
her and judge for yourselves. There
is her history—the world knows it by heart.
The past, at least, is secure. There is Boston
and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker’s
Hill; and there they will remain forever.
The bones of her sons, fallen in the great
struggle for independence, now lie mingled
with the soil of every State, from New England
to Georgia; and there they will lie forever.</p>

<h4>EULOGIUM ON SOUTH CAROLINA.</h4>

<p class="center">BY ROBERT T. HAYNE.</p>

<p>This distinguished American orator was born in the parish of Saint Paul,
South Carolina. His eminent ability soon secured for him a seat in the
United States Senate. The following is from one of his orations delivered
in the celebrated controversy between himself and Daniel Webster. It is
a glowing defense of his native state, and is memorable in the annals of
forensic eloquence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">If there be one State in the Union, and I
say it not in a boastful spirit, that may
challenge comparison with any other
for a uniform, zealous, ardent, and uncalculating
devotion to the Union, that State is
South Carolina. From the very commencement
of the Revolution, up to this hour,
there is no sacrifice, however great, she has
not cheerfully made, no service she has ever
hesitated to perform. She has adhered to
you in your prosperity; but in your adversity
she has clung to you with more than filial
affection.</p>

<p>No matter what was the condition of her
domestic affairs, though deprived of her resources,
divided by parties, or surrounded
by difficulties, the call of the country has
been to her as the voice of God. Domestic
discord ceased at the sound; every man
became reconciled to his brethren, and the
sons of Carolina were all seen crowding together
to the temple, bringing their gifts to
the altar of their common country.</p>

<p>What was the conduct of the South during
the Revolution? I honor New England
for her conduct in that glorious struggle.
But, great as is the praise which belongs to
her, I think at least equal honor is due to
the South. They espoused the quarrel of
their brethren with a generous zeal which
did not suffer them to stop to calculate their
interest in the dispute. Favorites of the
mother country, possessed of neither ships
nor seamen to create a commercial rivalship,
they might have found, in their situation, a
guarantee that their trade would be forever
fostered and protected by Great Britain.
But trampling on all considerations, either of
interest or safety, they rushed into the conflict,
and, fighting for principle, perilled all
in the sacred cause of freedom.</p>

<p>Never was there exhibited in the history<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
of the world higher examples of noble daring,
dreadful suffering, and heroic endurance
than by the Whigs of Carolina during the
Revolution! The whole State, from the
mountains to the sea, was overrun by an
overwhelming force of the enemy. The
fruits of industry perished on the spot where
they were produced, or were consumed by
the foe.</p>

<p>The “plains of Carolina” drank up the
most precious blood of her citizens. Black
and smoking ruins marked the places which
had been the habitations of her children.
Driven from their homes into the gloomy
and almost impenetrable swamps, even there
the spirit of liberty survived, and South Carolina,
sustained by the example of her Sumters
and her Marions, proved, by her conduct,
that, though her soil might be overrun,
the spirit of her people was invincible.</p>

<h4>THE CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.</h4>

<p class="center">BY WENDELL PHILLIPS.</p>

<p>It has been said of Mr. Phillips that in his public addresses he was
“a gentleman talking,” so easy and graceful was his manner. “The
golden-mouthed Phillips” was also an appropriate title. Considered simply
as an orator, perhaps our country has never produced his superior.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It matters very little what spot may have
been the birthplace of Washington. No
people can claim, no country can appropriate
him. The boon of Providence to
the human race, his fame is eternity, and his
residence creation. Though it was the defeat
of our arms, and the disgrace of our
policy, I almost bless the convulsion in which
he had his origin. If the heavens thundered,
and the earth rocked, yet, when the storm
had passed, how pure was the climate that it
cleared; how bright, in the brow of the
firmament, was the planet which it revealed
to us!</p>

<p>In the production of Washington, it does
really appear as if Nature was endeavoring
to improve upon herself, and that all the virtues
of the ancient world were but so many
studies preparatory to the patriot of the new.
Individual instances, no doubt, there were,
splendid exemplifications of some singular
qualification; Cæsar was merciful, Scipio was
continent, Hannibal was patient; but it was
reserved for Washington to bind them all in
one, and, like the lovely masterpiece of the
Grecian artist, to exhibit, in one glow of associated
beauty, the pride of every model,
and the perfection of every master.</p>

<p>As a general, he marshalled the peasant
into a veteran, and supplied by discipline the
absence of experience; as a statesman, he
enlarged the policy of the cabinet into the
most comprehensive system of general advantage;
and such was the wisdom of his
views, and the philosophy of his counsels,
that to the soldier, and the statesman he almost
added the character of the sage! A
conqueror, he was untainted with the crime
of blood; a revolutionist, he was free from
any stain of treason; for aggression commenced
the contest, and his country called
him to the command.</p>

<p>Liberty unsheathed his sword, necessity
stained, victory returned it. If he had paused
here, history might have doubted what station
to assign him; whether at the head of
her citizens or her soldiers, her heroes or
her patriots. But the last glorious act crowns
his career, and banishes all hesitation.</p>

<p>Who, like Washington, after having emancipated
a hemisphere, resigned its crown,
and preferred the retirement of domestic life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
to the adoration of a land he might almost
be said to have created?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How shall we rank thee upon Glory’s page,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou more than soldier, and just less than sage?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All thou hast been reflects less fame on thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far less, than all thou hast forborne to be!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such, sir, is the testimony of one not to be
accused of partiality in his estimate of America.
Happy, proud America! The lightnings
of heaven yielded to your philosophy!
The temptations of earth could not seduce
your patriotism.</p>

<h4>NATIONAL MONUMENT TO WASHINGTON.</h4>

<p class="center">BY ROBERT C. WINTHROP.</p>

<p>One of “Boston’s hundred orators” is the author of this eloquent oration,
which was delivered at the laying of the corner-stone of Washington’s
monument, that imposing shaft which is one of the greatest objects of
interest at our national capital. Scarcely any finer tribute was ever
paid to the Father of his Country. It should be delivered with full
volume of voice and sustained energy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Fellow-citizens, let us seize this
occasion to renew to each other our
vows of allegiance and devotion to
the American Union, and let us recognize
in our common title to the name and the
fame of Washington, and in our common
veneration for his example and his advice,
the all-sufficient centripetal power, which
shall hold the thick clustering stars of our
confederacy in one glorious constellation forever!
Let the column which we are about
to construct be at once a pledge and an
emblem of perpetual union!</p>

<p>Let the foundations be laid, let the superstructure
be built up and cemented, let each
stone be raised and riveted in a spirit of
national brotherhood! And may the earliest
ray of the rising sun—till that sun shall set
to rise no more—draw forth from it daily, as
from the fabled statue of antiquity, a strain
of national harmony, which shall strike a responsive
chord in every heart throughout
the republic!</p>

<p>Proceed, then, fellow-citizens, with the work
for which you have assembled. Lay the
corner-stone of a monument which shall adequately
bespeak the gratitude of the whole
American people to the illustrious father of
his country! Build it to the skies; you can
not outreach the loftiness of his principles!
Found it upon the massive and eternal rock;
you can not make it more enduring than his
fame! Construct it of the peerless Parian
marble; you cannot make it purer than his
life! Exhaust upon it the rules and principles
of ancient and of modern art; you cannot
make it more proportionate than his character.</p>

<p>But let not your homage to his memory
end here. Think not to transfer to a tablet
or a column the tribute which is due from
yourselves. Just honor to Washington can
only be rendered by observing his precepts
and imitating his example. He has built his
own monument. We, and those who come
after us, in successive generations, are its
appointed, its privileged guardians.</p>

<p>The wide-spread republic is the future
monument to Washington. Maintain its independence.
Uphold its constitution. Preserve
its union. Defend its liberty. Let it
stand before the world in all its original
strength and beauty, securing peace, order,
equality, and freedom, to all within its boundaries,
and shedding light and hope and joy
upon the pathway of human liberty throughout
the world—and Washington needs no
other monument. Other structures may testify
our veneration for him; this, alone can
adequately illustrate his service to mankind.</p>

<p>Nor does he need even this. The republic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
may perish; the wide arch of our ranged Union
may fall; star by star its glories may expire;
stone by stone its columns and its capitol may
moulder and crumble; all other names which
adorn its annals may be forgotten; but as
long as human hearts shall anywhere pant, or
human tongues anywhere plead, for a true, rational,
constitutional liberty, those hearts shall
enshrine the memory, and those tongues
prolong the fame, of George Washington.</p>

<h4>THE NEW WOMAN.</h4>

<p class="center">BY FRANCES E. WILLARD.</p>

<p>Although it is not customary to include women among orators, an exception
must be made in the case of Miss Willard. Few men have ever possessed her
command over popular audiences. Her eloquence drew multitudes to listen
to her burning appeals in behalf of the reforms of the day, among whom
were always many who protested that they “never liked to hear a woman
talk in public.”</p>

<p>Miss Willard’s remarkable gifts, her zeal and earnestness, and her
devotion to her cause, gave her a world-wide reputation. This extract
from one of her eloquent public addresses is bright in thought, wholesome
in sentiment, and is a model of effective speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="130" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Let us be grateful that our horizon is
widening. We women have learned
to reason from effect to cause. It
is considered a fine sign of a thinker to be
able to reason from cause to effect. But we,
in fourteen years’ march, have learned to go
from the drunkard in the gutter, who was
the object lesson we first saw, back to the
children, as you will hear to-night; back to
the idea of preventive, educational, evangelistic,
social, and legal work for temperance;
back to the basis of the saloon itself.</p>

<p>We have found that the liquor traffic is
joined hand in hand with the very sources of
the National Government. And we have come
to the place where we want prohibition, first,
last, and all the time. While the brewer talks
about his “vested interests,” I lend my voice
to the motherhood of the nation that has
gone down into the valley of unutterable pain
and in the shadow of death, with the dews
of eternity upon the mother’s brow, given
birth and being to the sons who are the
“vested interests” of America’s homes.</p>

<p>We offset the demand of the brewer and
distiller, that you shall protect their ill-gotten
gains, with the thought of these most sacred
treasures, dear to the hearts that you, our
brothers, honor—dear to the hearts that you
love best. I bring to you this thought, to-night,
that you shall vote to represent us, and
hasten the time when we can represent ourselves.</p>

<p>I believe that we are going out into this
work, being schooled and inspired for greater
things than we have dreamed, and that the
army of women will prove the grandest sisterhood
the world has ever known. As I
have seen the love and kindness and good-will
of women who differed so widely from
us politically and religiously, and yet have
found away down in the depths of their
hearts the utmost love and affection, I have
said, what kind of a world will this be when
all women are as fond of each other as we
strong-minded women are?</p>

<p>Home is the citadel of everything that is
good and pure on earth; nothing must enter
there to defile, neither anything which loveth
or maketh a lie. And it shall be found that
all society needed to make it altogether
homelike was the home-folks; that all government
needed to make it altogether pure
from the fumes of tobacco and the debasing
effects of strong drink, was the home-folks;
that wherever you put a woman who has the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
atmosphere or home about her, she brings
in the good time of pleasant and friendly
relationship, and points with the finger of
hope and the eye of faith always to something
better—always it is better farther on.</p>

<p>As I look around and see the heavy cloud
of apathy under which so many still are
stifled, who take no interest in these things,
I just think they do not half mean the hard
words that they sometimes speak to us, or
they wouldn’t if they knew; and, after awhile,
they will have the same views I have, spell
them with a capital V, and all be harmonious,
like Barnum’s happy family, a splendid menagerie
of the whole human race—clear-eyed,
kind and victorious!</p>

<h4>AN APPEAL FOR LIBERTY.</h4>

<p class="center">BY JOSEPH STORY.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I call upon you, fathers, by the shades
of your ancestors—by the dear ashes
which repose in this precious soil—by
all you are, and all you hope to be—resist
every object of disunion, resist every encroachment
upon your liberties, resist every
attempt to fetter your consciences, or smother
your public schools, or extinguish your system
of public instruction.</p>

<p>I call upon you, mothers, by that which
never fails in woman, the love of your offspring;
teach them, as they climb your
knees, or lean on your bosoms, the blessings
of liberty. Swear them at the altar, as with
their baptismal vows, to be true to their
country, and never to forget or forsake her.</p>

<p>I call upon you, young men, to remember
whose sons you are; whose inheritance you
possess. Life can never be too short, which
brings nothing but disgrace and oppression.
Death never comes too soon, if necessary
in defence of the liberties of your
country.</p>

<p>I call upon you, old men, for your counsels,
and your prayers, and your benedictions.
May not your gray hairs go down in sorrow
to the grave, with the recollection that you
have lived in vain. May not your last sun
sink in the west upon a nation of slaves.</p>

<p>No; I read in the destiny of my country far
better hopes, far brighter visions. We, who are
now assembled here, must soon be gathered
to the congregation of other days. The time
of our departure is at hand, to make way
for our children upon the theatre of life. May
God speed them and theirs. May he who,
at the distance of another century, shall stand
here to celebrate this day, still look round
upon a free, happy, and virtuous people. May
he have reason to exult as we do. May he,
with all the enthusiasm of truth as well as of
poetry, exclaim, that here is still his country.</p>

<h4>THE TRUE SOURCE OF REFORM.</h4>

<p class="center">BY EDWIN H. CHAPIN.</p>

<p>As a pulpit orator and lecturer Mr. Chapin was widely known and popular.
His style was ornate and finished, and when to this was added his grand
voice and magnetic delivery, his audiences could not resist the charm of
his eloquence. His opinions placed him in the front ranks of reformers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The great element of reform is not born
of human wisdom, it does not draw
its life from human organizations. I
find it only in Christianity. “Thy kingdom
come!” There is a sublime and pregnant
burden in this prayer. It is the aspiration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
of every soul that goes forth in the spirit of
Reform. For what is the significance of
this prayer? It is a petition that all holy
influences would penetrate and subdue and
dwell in the heart of man, until he shall
think, and speak, and do good, from the very
necessity of his being.</p>

<p>So would the institutions of error and
wrong crumble and pass away. So would
sin die out from the earth; and the human
soul living in harmony with the Divine
will, this earth would become like heaven.
It is too late for the reformers to sneer
at Christianity—it is foolishness for them
to reject it. In it are enshrined our faith
in human progress—our confidence in reform.
It is indissolubly connected with
all that is hopeful, spiritual, capable, in
man.</p>

<p>That men have misunderstood it, and
perverted it, is true. But it is also true that
the noblest efforts for human melioration
have come out of it—have been based upon
it. Is it not so? Come, ye remembered
ones, who sleep the sleep of the just—who
took your conduct from the line of Christian
philosophy—come from your tombs, and
answer!</p>

<p>Come, Howard, from the gloom of the
prison and the taint of the lazar-house, and
show us what philanthropy can do when
imbued with the spirit of Jesus. Come,
Eliot, from the thick forest where the red
man listens to the Word of Life;—Come,
Penn, from thy sweet counsel and weaponless
victory—and show us what Christian
zeal and Christian love can accomplish with
the rudest barbarians or the fiercest hearts.
Come, Raikes, from thy labors with the
ignorant and the poor, and show us with
what an eye this faith regards the lowest
and least of our race; and how diligently it
labors, not for the body, not for the rank,
but for the plastic soul that is to course the
ages of immortality.</p>

<p>And ye, who are a great number—ye
nameless ones—who have done good in
your narrow spheres, content to forego
renown on earth, and seeking your reward
in the record on high—come and tell us
how kindly a spirit, how lofty a purpose, or
how strong a courage the religion ye professed
can breathe into the poor, the humble,
and the weak. Go forth, then, Spirit of
Christianity, to thy great work of Reform.
The past bears witness to thee in the blood
of thy martyrs, and the ashes of thy saints
and heroes; the present is hopeful because
of thee; the future shall acknowledge thy
omnipotence.</p>

<h4>APPEAL TO YOUNG MEN.</h4>

<p class="center">BY LYMAN BEECHER.</p>

<p>A rather small wiry man with strong face, compact fibre, quick motions,
great earnestness and pulpit ability of the highest order—this was Lyman
Beecher. He made himself especially prominent in the early days of the
temperance reformation. The selection here given is one of many similar
utterances and is full of force and fire.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-c.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Could I call around me in one vast
assembly the temperate young men
of our land, I would say,—Hopes
of the nation, blessed be ye of
the Lord now in the dew of your youth.
But look well to your footsteps; for vipers,
and scorpions, and adders surround your
way.</p>

<p>Look at the generation who have just preceded
you: the morning of their life was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
cloudless, and it dawned as brightly as
your own; but behold them bitten, swollen,
enfeebled, inflamed, debauched, idle,
poor, irreligious, and vicious, with halting
step dragging onward to meet an
early grave! Their bright prospects are
clouded, and their sun is set never to rise.
No house of their own receives them,
while from poorer to poorer tenements
they descend, and to harder and harder
fare, as improvidence dries up their resources.</p>

<p>And now, who are those that wait on their
footsteps with muffled faces and sable garments?
That is a father—and that is a
mother—whose gray hairs are coming with
sorrow to the grave. That is a sister, weeping
over evils which she cannot arrest;
and there is the broken-hearted wife; and
there are the children, hapless innocents,
for whom their father has provided the inheritance
only of dishonor, and nakedness
and woe.</p>

<p>And is this, beloved young men, the
history of your course? In this scene of
desolation, do you behold the image of
your future selves? Is this the poverty
and disease which, as an armed man, shall
take hold on you? And are your fathers,
and mothers, and sisters, and wives, and
children, to succeed to those who now move
on in this mournful procession, weeping
as they go? Yes: bright as your morning
now opens, and high as your hopes
beat, this is your noon, and your night,
unless you shun those habits of intemperance
which have thus early made theirs a
day of clouds, and of thick darkness. If
you frequent places of evening resort for
social drinking; if you set out with drinking,
daily, a little, temperately, prudently, it is
yourselves which, as in a glass, you behold.</p>

<h4>THE PILGRIMS.</h4>

<p class="center">BY CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW.</p>

<p>Mr. Depew is considered one of the foremost of our American orators, and
it is enough to say he has risen to this distinction in a land noted
for the eloquence of its public men. He is an excellent extemporaneous
speaker, is graceful and easy in manner, fluent in utterance, and has a
touch of humor that renders him popular. His tribute to the Pilgrims is
worthy of a theme so inspiring.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">They were practical statesmen, these
Pilgrims. They wasted no time theorizing
upon methods, but went straight
at the mark. They solved the Indian problem
with shot-guns, and it was not General
Sherman, but Miles Standish, who originated
the axiom that the only good Indians are the
dead ones. They were bound by neither
customs nor traditions, nor committals to
this or that policy. The only question with
them was, Does it work? The success of
their Indian experiment led them to try
similar methods with witches, Quakers and
Baptists.</p>

<p>Their failure taught them the difference
between mind and matter. A dead savage
was another wolf under ground, but one of
themselves persecuted or killed for conscience
sake sowed the seed of discontent and disbelief.
The effort to wall in a creed and wall
out liberty was at once abandoned, and to-day
New England has more religions and
not less religion, but less bigotry, than any
other community in the world.</p>

<p>In an age when dynamite was unknown,
the Pilgrim invented in the cabin of the Mayflower
the most powerful of explosives. The
declaration of the equality of all men before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
the law has rocked thrones and consolidated
classes. It separated the colonies from Great
Britain and created the United States. It
pulverized the chains of the slaves and gave
manhood suffrage. It devolved upon the
individual the functions of government and
made the people the sole source of power.
It substituted the cap of liberty for the royal
crown in France, and by a bloodless revolution
has added to the constellation of American
republics, the star of Brazil.</p>

<p>But with the ever-varying conditions incident
to free government, the Puritan’s talent
as a political mathematician will never rust.
Problems of the utmost importance press
upon him for solution. When, in the effort
to regulate the liquor traffic, he has advanced
beyond the temper of the times and the sentiment
of the people in the attempt to enact
or enforce prohibition, and either been disastrously
defeated or the flagrant evasions of
the statutes have brought the law into contempt,
he does not despair, but tries to find
the error in his calculation.</p>

<p>If gubernatorial objections block the way
of high license he will bombard the executive
judgment and conscience by a proposition to
tax. The destruction of homes, the ruin of
the young, the increase of pauperism and
crime, the added burdens upon the taxpayers
by the evils of intemperance, appeal with
resistless force to his training and traditions.
As the power of the saloon increases the
difficulties of the task, he becomes more and
more certain that some time or other and in
some way or other he will do that sum too.</p>

<h4>PATRIOTISM A REALITY.</h4>

<p class="center">BY THOMAS FRANCIS MEAGHER.</p>

<p>All Americans ought to feel kindly disposed toward this eloquent Irish
patriot, for he not only risked his life in the cause of Irish liberty,
but also in our own Civil War. This oration has a rugged strength
and blunt earnestness quite characteristic of the man. Let it not be
delivered in any feeble halting manner, but with all your nerve and
energy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Sir, the pursuit of liberty must cease
to be a traffic. It must resume
among us its ancient glory—be
with us an active heroism. Once
for all, sir, we must have an end of this
money making in the public forum. We
must ennoble the strife for liberty; make it a
gallant sacrifice, not a vulgar game; rescue
the cause of Ireland from the profanation of
those who beg, and from the control of those
who bribe!</p>

<p>Ah! trust not those dull philosophers of
the age, those wretched sceptics, who, to rebuke
our enthusiasm, our folly, would persuade
us that patriotism is but a delusion, a
dream of youth, a wild and glittering passion;
that it has died out in this nineteenth century;
that it cannot exist with our advanced civilization—with
the steam-engine and free trade!</p>

<p>False—false!—The virtue that gave to
Paganism its dazzling lustre, to Barbarism its
redeeming trait, to Christianity its heroic
form, is not dead. It still lives, to preserve,
to console, to sanctify humanity. It has its
altar in every clime—its worship and festivities.
On the heathered hills of Scotland, the
sword of Wallace is yet a bright tradition.
The genius of France, in the brilliant literature
of the day, pays its high homage to the
piety and heroism of the young Maid of
Orleans.</p>

<p>In her new senate hall, England bids her
sculptor place among the effigies of her
greatest sons the images of Hampden and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
of Russell. By the soft blue waters of Lake
Lucerne stands the chapel of William Tell.
At Innsbruck, in the black aisle of the old
cathedral, the peasant of the Tyrol kneels
before the statue of Andrew Hofer. In the
great American republic—in that capital city
which bears his name—rises the monument
of the Father of his country.</p>

<p>Sir, shall we not join in this glorious homage,
and here in this island, consecrated by
the blood of many a good and gallant man,
shall we not have the faith, the duties, the
festivities, of patriotism? You discard the
weapons of these heroic men—do not discard
the virtues. Elevate the national character;
confront corruption wherever it appears;
scourge it from the hustings; scourge it
from the public forum; and, whilst proceeding
with the noble task to which you have
devoted your lives and fortunes, let this
thought enrapture and invigorate your hearts:
That in seeking the independence of your
country, you have preserved her virtue—preserved
it at once from the seductions of a
powerful minister, and from the infidelity of
bad citizens.</p>

<p>As a historian Macaulay has a world-wide reputation. As a poet he takes
high rank. As an orator his speeches are characterized by lofty thought,
felicitious language and the most elaborate style. I would call him a
graceful giant. The last paragraph of the following selection in which
he predicts the final decay of England, has created an endless amount
of comment and criticism. Concerning the beauty and grandeur of this
selection from his writings, there can be but one opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">All the triumphs of truth and genius
over prejudice and power, in every
country and in every age, have
been the triumphs of Athens.
Whenever a few great minds have made a
stand against violence and fraud, in the cause
of liberty and reason, there has been her
spirit in the midst of them; inspiring, encouraging,
and consoling. It stood by the
lonely lamp of Erasmus; by the restless bed
of Pascal; in the tribune of Mirabeau; in
the cell of Galileo; on the scaffold of Sidney.</p>

<p>But who shall estimate her influence on
private happiness? Who shall say how
many thousands have been made wiser, happier,
and better, by those pursuits in which
she has taught mankind to engage; to how
many the studies which took their rise from
her have been wealth in poverty; liberty in
bondage; health in sickness; society in solitude.
Her power is indeed manifested at the
bar, in the senate; in the field of battle, in
the schools of philosophy.</p>

<p>But these are not her glory. Surely it is no
exaggeration to say, that no external advantage
is to be compared with that purification
of the intellectual eye, which gives us to contemplate
the infinite wealth of the mental
world; all the hoarded treasures of the primeval
dynasties, all the shapeless ore of the
yet unexplored mines.</p>

<p>This is the gift of Athens to man. Her
freedom and her power have for more than
twenty centuries been annihilated. Her people
have degenerated into timid slaves; her
language, into a barbarous jargon. Her
temples have been given up to the successive
depredations of Romans, Turks, and Scotchmen;
but her intellectual empire is imperishable.</p>

<p>And, when those who have rivaled her
greatness, shall have shared her fate; when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
civilization and knowledge shall have fixed
their abode in distant continents; when the
sceptre shall have passed away from England;
when, perhaps, travelers from distant regions
shall in vain labor to decipher on some mouldering
pedestal the name of our proudest
chief; and shall see a single naked fisherman
wash his nets in the river of the ten thousand
masts; her influence and her glory will still
survive, fresh in eternal youth, exempt from
mutability and decay, immortal as the intellectual
principle from which they derived
their origin, and over which they exercise
their control.</p>

<h4>THE IRISH CHURCH.</h4>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM E. GLADSTONE.</p>

<p>No man in England, or in fact in the whole world, has gained so high
a distinction in modern times for statesmanship and eloquence as Mr.
Gladstone. Possessed of vast resources of brain and culture, a remarkable
command of language, an iron will and an enthusiasm in behalf of every
cause he espoused that was checked by no opposition, the “Grand Old Man,”
as he was called, was the most majestic and commanding figure in English
politics and literature for a generation. His oration on the Irish Church
is a good specimen of his impassioned oratory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">If we are prudent men, I hope we shall
endeavor as far as in us lies to make
some provision for a contingent, a
doubtful, and probably a dangerous future.
If we be chivalrous men, I trust we shall endeavor
to wipe away all those stains which
the civilized world has for ages seen, or
seemed to see, on the shield of England in
her treatment of Ireland. If we be compassionate
men, I hope we shall now, once for
all, listen to the tale of woe which comes
from her, and the reality of which, if not its
justice, is testified by the continuous emigration
of her people—that we shall endeavor
to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pluck from her memory a rooted sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And raze the written troubles from her brain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, above all, if we be just men, we shall go
forward in the name of truth and right, bearing
this in mind—that, when the case is
proved and the hour is come, justice delayed
is justice denied.</p>

<p>There are many who think that to lay
hands upon the national Church Establishment
of a country is a profane and unhallowed
act. I respect that feeling. I sympathize
with it. I sympathize with it while
I think it my duty to overcome and repress
it. But if it be an error, it is an error entitled
to respect. There is something in the
idea of a national establishment of religion,
of a solemn appropriation of a part of the
Commonwealth for conferring upon all who
are ready to receive it what we know to be
an inestimable benefit; of saving that portion
of the inheritance from private selfishness, in
order to extract from it, if we can, pure and
unmixed advantages of the highest order for
the population at large.</p>

<p>There is something in this so attractive
that it is an image that must always command
the homage of the many. It is somewhat
like the kingly ghost in Hamlet, of
which one of the characters of Shakespeare
says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We do it wrong, being so majestical,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To offer it the show of violence;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And our vain blows malicious mockery”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, sir, this is to view a religious establishment
upon one side, only upon what I
may call the ethereal side. It has likewise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
a side of earth; and here I cannot do better
than quote some lines written by the Archbishop
of Dublin, at a time when his genius
was devoted to the muses. He said, in
speaking of mankind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We who did our lineage high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draw from beyond the starry sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are yet upon the other side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To earth and to its dust allied.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so the Church Establishment, regarded
in its theory and in its aim, is beautiful
and attractive. Yet what is it but an
appropriation of public property, an appropriation
of the fruits of labor and of skill to
certain purposes, and unless these purposes
are fulfilled, that appropriation cannot be
justified. Therefore, Sir, I cannot but feel
that we must set aside fears which thrust
themselves upon the imagination, and act
upon the sober dictates of our judgment.</p>

<p>I think it has been shown that the cause
for action is strong—not for precipitate action,
not for action beyond our powers, but
for such action as the opportunities of the
times and the condition of Parliament, if
there be but a ready will, will amply and
easily admit of. If I am asked as to my expectations
of the issue of this struggle, I
begin frankly by avowing that I, for one,
would not have entered into it unless I believed
that the final hour was about to sound.</p>

<p>And I hope that the noble lord will forgive
me if I say that before Friday last I
thought that the thread of the remaining life
of the Irish Established Church was short,
but that since Friday last, when at half-past
four o’clock in the afternoon the noble lord
stood at that table, I have regarded it as being
shorter still. The issue is not in our hands.</p>

<p>What we had and have to do is to consider
well and deeply before we take the first
step in an engagement such as this; but
having entered into the controversy, there
and then to acquit ourselves like men, and
to use every effort to remove what still remains
of the scandals and calamities in the
relations which exist between England and
Ireland, and use our best efforts at least to
fill up with the cement of human concord the
noble fabric of the British empire.</p>

<h4>APPEAL TO THE HUNGARIANS.</h4>

<p class="center">BY LOUIS KOSSUTH.</p>

<p>The eminent Hungarian orator and statesman, whose name for a whole
generation stood for liberty, visited our country in his early manhood
and received an ovation wherever he went. His progress was a triumphal
march. This was due not merely to the fact that he was exerting all his
energies to liberate his country, but his reception was a tribute to his
brilliant genius and overpowering eloquence. Kossuth was one of the most
remarkable orators of modern times. The following selection is a fine
illustration of his impassioned, burning eloquence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="80" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Our fatherland is in danger. Citizens
of the fatherland! To arms! To
arms! If we believed the country
could be saved by ordinary means, we would
not cry that it is in danger. If we stood at
the head of a cowardly, childish nation,
which, in the hour of peril, prefers defeat to
defence, we would not sound the alarm-bell.
But because we know that the people of our
land compose a manly nation, determined to
defend itself against oppression, we call out
in the loudest voice, “Our fatherland is in
danger!” Because we are sure that the nation
is able to defend its hearths and homes,
we announce the peril in all its magnitude,
and appeal to our brethren, in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
God and their country, to look the danger
boldly in the face.</p>

<p>We will not smile and flatter. We say it
plainly, that unless the nation rise, to a man,
prepared to shed the last drop of blood, all
our previous struggles will have been in vain.
The noble blood that has flowed like water,
will have been wasted. Our fatherland will be
crushed to the earth. On the soil, where
rest the ashes of our ancestors, the Russian
knout will be wielded over a people reduced
beneath the yoke of slavery.</p>

<p>If we wish to shut our eyes to the danger,
we shall thereby save no one from its power.
If we represent the matter as it is, we make
our country master of its own fate. If the
breath of life is in our people, they will save
themselves and their fatherland. But, if
paralyzed by coward fear, they remain supine,
all will be lost. God will help no man who
does not help himself. We tell you that the
Austrian Emperor sends the hordes of Russian
barbarians for your destruction.</p>

<p>People of Hungary! Would you die under
the destroying sword of the barbarous Russians?
If not, defend your own lives! Would
you see the Cossacks of the distant north
trampling under foot the dishonored bodies
of your fathers, your wives, and your children?
If not, defend yourselves! Do you
wish that your fellow-countrymen should be
dragged away to Siberia, or should fight for
tyrants in a foreign land, or writhe in slavery
beneath a Russian scourge? If not, defend
yourselves! Would you see your villages in
flames, and your harvest-fields in ruins?
Would you die of hunger on the soil which
you have cultivated with sweat and blood?
If not, defend yourselves!</p>

<p>This strife is not a strife between two hostile
camps, but a war of tyranny against freedom,
of barbarians against the collective
might of a free nation. Therefore must the
whole people arise with the army. If these
millions sustain our army, we have gained
freedom and victory for universal Europe, as
well as for ourselves. Therefore, O strong,
gigantic people, unite with the army, and rush
to the conflict. Ho! every freeman! To arms!
To arms! Thus alone is victory certain.</p>

<h4>THE TYRANT VERRES DENOUNCED.</h4>

<p class="center">BY CICERO.</p>

<p>This oration is inserted here to furnish an example of the style of the
great Roman orator whose eloquence has been proverbial from his time
to the present. His patriotic utterances should stir the blood of the
reciter, and if they do this his hearers will share the inspiration.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">An opinion has long prevailed, fathers,
that, in public prosecutions, men of
wealth, however clearly convicted,
are always safe. This opinion, so injurious
to your order, so detrimental to the state, it
is now in your power to refute. A man is
on trial before you who is rich, and he hopes
his riches will compass his acquittal; but
whose life and actions are his sufficient condemnation
in the eyes of all candid men. I
speak of Caius Verres, who, if he now receive
not the sentence his crimes deserve, it shall
not be through the lack of a criminal or of a
prosecutor, but through the failure of the
ministers of justice to do their duty.</p>

<p>Passing over the shameful irregularities of
his youth, what does the quæstorship of
Verres exhibit but one continued scene of
villanies? The public treasure squandered,
a consul stripped and betrayed, an army
deserted and reduced to want, a province
robbed, the civil and religious rights of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
people trampled on! But his prætorship in
Sicily has crowned his career of wickedness,
and completed the lasting monument of his
infamy. His decisions have violated all law,
all precedent, all right. His extortions from
the industrious poor have been beyond computation.
Our most faithful allies have been
treated as enemies. Roman citizens have,
like slaves, been put to death with tortures.
Men the most worthy have been condemned
and banished without a hearing, while the
most atrocious criminals have, with money,
purchased exemption from the punishment
due to their guilt.</p>

<p>I ask now, Verres, what have you to
advance against these charges? Art thou
not the tyrant Prætor, who, at no greater
distance than Sicily, within sight of the Italian
coast, dared to put to an infamous
death, on the cross, that ill-fated and innocent
citizen, Publius Gavius Cosanus?
And what was his offence? He had declared
his intention of appealing to the
justice of his country against your brutal
persecutions!</p>

<p>For this, when about to embark for home,
he was seized, brought before you, charged
with being a spy, scourged and tortured. In
vain did he exclaim: “I am a Roman citizen!
I have served under Lucius Pretius,
who is now at Panormus, and who will attest
my innocence!” Deaf to all remonstrance,
remorseless, thirsting for innocent blood, you
ordered the savage punishment to be inflicted!
While the sacred words, “I am a
Roman citizen,” were on his lips—words
which, in the remotest regions, are a passport
to protection—you ordered him to death—to
a death upon the cross!</p>

<p>O liberty! O sound once delightful to
every Roman ear! O sacred privilege of
Roman citizenship! once sacred—now trampled
on! Is it come to this? Shall an inferior
magistrate—a governor, who holds his
whole power of the Roman people—in a
Roman province, within sight of Italy, bind,
scourge, torture, and put to an infamous death,
a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries
of innocence expiring in agony, the tears of
pitying spectators, the majesty of the Roman
commonwealth, nor the fear of the justice of
his country, restrain the merciless monster,
who, in the confidence of his riches, strikes
at the very root of liberty, and sets mankind
at defiance? And shall this man escape?
Fathers, it must not be! It must not be unless
you would undermine the very foundations
of social safety, strangle justice, and
call down anarchy, massacre, and ruin on the
commonwealth.</p>

<h4>TIM MURPHY MAKES A FEW REMARKS.</h4>

<p>A good specimen of the Irish brogue and wit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">I saw Teddy Reagan the other day; he
told me he had been dealing in hogs.
“Is business good?” says I. “Yis,”
says he. “Talking about hogs, Teddy, how
do you find yourself?” sez I. I wint to buy
a clock the other day, to make a present to
Mary Jane. “Will you have a Frinch clock?”
says the jeweler. “The deuce take your
Frinch clock,” sez I. “I want a clock that
my sister can understand when it strikes.”
“I have a Dutch clock,” sez he, “an’ you
kin put that on the shtairs.” “It might run
down if I put it there,” sez I. “Well,” sez
he, “here’s a Yankee clock, with a lookin’-glass
in the front, so that you can see yourself,”
sez he. “It’s too ugly,” sez I. “Thin
I’ll take the lookin’-glass out, an’ whin you
look at it you’ll not find it so ugly,” sez
he.</p>

<p>I wint to Chatham Sthreet to buy a shirt,
for the one I had on was a thrifle soiled. The
Jew who kept the sthore looked at my bosom,
an’ said: “So hellup me gracious! how long
do you vear a shirt?” “Twinty-eight inches,”
sez I. “Have you any fine shirts?” sez I.
“Yis,” sez he. “Are they clane?” says I.
“Yis,” sez he. “Thin you had better put
one on,” sez I.</p>

<p>You may talk about bringin’ up childer in
the way they should go, but I believe in
bringing them up by the hair of the head.
Talking about bringing up childer—I hear
my childer’s prayers every night. The other
night I let thim up to bed without thim. I
skipped and sthood behind the door. I heard
the big boy say: “Give us this day our daily
bread.” The little fellow said: “Sthrike him
for pie, Johnny.” I have one of the most
economical boys in the Citty of New York;
he hasn’t spint one cint for the last two years.
I am expecting him down from Sing Sing
prison next week.</p>

<p>Talking about boys, I have a nephew who,
five years ago, couldn’t write a word. Last
week he wrote his name for $10,000; he’ll
git tin years in the pinatintiary. I can’t
write, but I threw a brick at a policeman
and made my mark.</p>

<p>They had a fight at Tim Owen’s wake last
week. Mary Jane was there. She says, barrin’
herself, there was only one whole nose left in
the party, an’ that belonged to the tay-kettle.</p>

<h4>PASSING OF THE HORSE.</h4>

    <div class="dropcapline">I drove my old horse, Dobbin, full slowly toward the town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One beautiful spring morning. The rising sun looked down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And saw us slowly jogging and drinking in the balm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of honeyed breath of clover fields. We lissed, in Nature’s calm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To chirping squirrel, and whistling bird, the robin and the wren;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sound of life and love and peace came o’er the fields again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Way back behind the wagon there came a tandem bike,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A pedaling ’long to beat the wind, I never saw the like.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They started by—the road was wide, old Dobbin feeling good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The quiet calmness of the morn had livened up his mood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stretching out adown the road he chased these cyclers two,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Dobbin in his younger days was distanced by but few.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">We sped along about a mile, it was a merry chase,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Dobbin gave it up at last, and, dropping from the race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He looked at me, as if to say: “Old man, I’m in disgrace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The horse is surely passing by, the bike has got his place”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all that day, while in the town, old Dobbin’s spirits fell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His stout old pride was broken sure; the reason I could tell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when that night we trotted back from town, below the hill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We met two weary cyclers who waved at us a bill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That had a big V on it, and said it would be mine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I would let them ride with us and put their bike behind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so I whistled softly; and Dobbin winked at me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I guess the horse will stay, old man; he’s puncture proof—you see?”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">As when the bee explores the rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We see the petals tremble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So trembled Mary’s rosebud lips—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her heart would not dissemble.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wouldn’t whip him <i>very</i> hard”—</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">It didn’t hurt at all!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“What made you cry, then, Mary Ann?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The school’s noise makes a pause,</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Now, then,” said the short and fat
and anxious-looking man as he
sat down in the street car and
unfolded a map he had just
bought of a fakir. “I want to know how
this old thing works. Let me first find the
Philippine Islands and Manila. Here I am,
and here is Ca-vitt.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the man on
his left, “but that name is pronounced Kah-vee-tay.”</p>

<p>“Then why ain’t it spelled that way?”
demanded the short and fat man. “No
wonder Dooye has been left there a whole
month without reinforcements when they
mix up things that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“You mean Dewey,” corrected the man
on his right.</p>

<p>“I heard it called Dooye, sir.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t right.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t this map give it right?
Is it the plan of our map-makers to bamboozle
the American patriot? Let us turn
to Cuba. Ah! here is that San Jew-an they
are talking so much about.”</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to say that the name
is pronounced San Wan?” softly observed
the man on the left.</p>

<p>“By whom, sir?”</p>

<p>“By everybody.”</p>

<p>“I deny it, sir!” exclaimed the fat man.
“If J-u-a-n don’t spell ‘Juan’ then I can’t
read. If I am wrong then why don’t this
map set me right? Is it the idea to mix up
the American patriot until he can’t tell
whether he’s in Cuba or the United States?”</p>

<p>“Where is that Ci-en-fue-gos I’ve read
about?”</p>

<p>“Do you wish for the correct pronunciation
of that name?” asked a man on the
other side of the car.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I got it?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then let her slide. The men who got
out this map ought to be indicted for swindling.
Maybe I’m wrong in calling it Ma-tan-zas?”</p>

<p>“It is hardly correct, sir.”</p>

<p>“And I’m off on Por-to Ri-co?”</p>

<p>“Just a little off.”</p>

<p>“That settles it, sir—that settles it!” said
the short man as he folded up the map and
tossed it away on the street. “I had a
grandfather in the Revolutionary War, a
father in the war with Mexico, and two
brothers in the late Civil War, and I was
going to offer my services to Uncle Sam in
this emergency; but it’s off, sir—all off.”</p>

<p>“But what difference does the pronunciation
make?” protested the man on the right.</p>

<p>“All the difference in the world, sir. My
wife is tongue-tied and my only child has
got a hare-lip, and if I should get killed
neither one of them would be able to ever
make any one understand whether I poured
out my blood in a battle in Cuba or was run
over by an ice-wagon in front of my own
house!”</p>

<h4>HOW A MARRIED MAN SEWS ON A BUTTON.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is bad enough to see a bachelor sew
on a button, but he is the embodiment
of grace alongside a married man.
Necessity has compelled experience in the
case of the former, but the latter has depended
upon some one else for this service,
and fortunately for the sake of society, it is
rarely he is obliged to resort to the needle himself.
Sometimes the patient wife scalds her
right hand, or runs a sliver under the nail of
the index finger of that hand, and it is then the
man clutches the needle around the neck,
and, forgetting to tie a knot on the thread,
commences to put on the button.</p>

<p>It is always in the morning, and from five
to twenty minutes after this he is expected
to be down street. He lays the button on
exactly the site of its predecessor, and pushes
the needle through one eye, and carefully
draws the thread after, leaving about three
inches of it sticking up for leeway. He says
to himself, “Well, if women don’t have the
easiest time I ever see.”</p>

<p>Then he comes back the other way and
gets the needle through the cloth easy
enough, and lays himself out to find the eye,
but, in spite of a great deal of patient jabbing,
the needle point persists in bucking against
the solid parts of the button, and finally,
when he loses patience, his fingers catch the
thread, and that three inches he has left to
hold the button slips through the eye in a
twinkling, and the button rolls leisurely
across the floor. He picks it up without a
single remark, out of respect for his children,
and makes another attempt to fasten it.</p>

<p>This time, when coming back with the
needle, he keeps both the thread and button
from slipping, by covering them with his
thumb; and it is out of regard for that part
of him that he feels around for the eye in a
very careful and judicious manner, but eventually
losing his philosophy as the search
becomes more and more hopeless, he falls to
jabbing about in a loose and savage manner,
and it is just then the needle finds the opening
and comes up the button and part way
through his thumb with a celerity that no
human ingenuity can guard against. Then
he lays down the things with a few familiar
quotations, and presses the injured hand between
his knees, and then holds it under the
other arm, and finally jams it into his mouth,
and all the while he prances and calls upon
heaven and earth to witness that there has
never been anything like it since the world
was created, and howls, and whistles, and
moans and sobs. After a while he calms
down and puts on his pants and fastens them
together with a stick, and goes to his business
a changed man.</p>

<h4>THE DUTCHMAN’S SERENADE.</h4>

<p>You do not need any set tune for the words to be sung. It will be more
amusing to have none, but to extemporize as you go along. Stop singing
when you come to the words in parenthesis and speak them. To complete the
impersonation, you should have a violin. Do not recite German dialect
pieces too rapidly; the words should be pronounced very distinctly.</p>

<h4>BIDDY’S TROUBLES.</h4>

<p>If this selection were recited in the costume of a housemaid, with apron,
sunbonnet and bare arms, the effect would be intensified. Place the hands
on the hips except when gesticulating.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“It’s thru for me, Katy, that I never seed
the like of this people afore. It’s a
time I’ve been having since coming
to this house, twelve months agone this week
Thursday. Yer know, honey, that my fourth
coosin, Ann Macarthy, recommended me to
Mrs. Whaler, and told the lady that I knew
about genteel housework and the likes; while
at the same time I had niver seed inter an
American lady’s kitchen.</p>

<p>“So she engaged me, and my heart was
jist ready to burst wid grief for the story that
Ann had told, for Mrs. Whaler was a swate-spoken
lady, and never looked cross-like in
her life; that I knew by her smooth, kind
face. Well, jist the first thing she told me to
do, after I dressed the children, was to dress
the ducks for dinner. I stood looking at the
lady for a couple of minutes, before I could
make out any maneing at all to her words.</p>

<p>“Thin I went searching after clothes for the
ducks; and such a time as I had, to be sure.
High and low I went till at last my mistress
axed me for what I was looking; and
I told her the clothes for the ducks, to be sure.
Och, how she scramed and laughed, till my
face was as rid as the sun wid shame, and she
showed me in her kind swate way what her
maneing was. Thin she told me how to air
the beds; and it was a day for me, indade, when
I could go up chamber alone and clare up the
rooms. One day Mrs. Whaler said to me:</p>

<p>“‘Biddy, an’ ye may give the baby an
airin’, if yees will.’</p>

<p>“What should I do—and it’s thru what I
am saying this blessed minute—but go upstairs
wid the child, and shake it, and then
howld it out of the winder. Such a scraming
and kicking as the baby gave—but I hild on
the harder. Everybody thin in the strate’
looked at me; at last misthress came up to
see what for was so much noise.</p>

<p>“‘I am thrying to air the baby,’ I said,
‘but it kicks and scrames dridfully.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“There was company down below; and
whin Mrs. Whaler told them what I had been
after doing, I thought they would scare the
folks in the strate wid scraming.</p>

<p>“And then I was told I must do up Mr.
Whaler’s sharts one day when my mistress
was out shopping. She told me repeatedly
to do them up nice, for master was going
away, so I takes the sharts and did them all
up in some paper that I was after bringing
from the ould country wid me, and tied some
nice pink ribbon around the bundle.</p>

<p>“‘Where are the sharts, Biddy?’ axed
Mrs. Whaler, when she comed home.</p>

<p>“‘I have been doing them up in a quair
nice way,’ I said, bringing her the bundle.</p>

<p>“‘Will you iver be done wid your graneness!’
she axed me with a loud scrame.</p>

<p>“I can’t for the life of me be tellin’ what
their talkin’ manes. At home we call the
likes of this fine work starching; and a deal
of it I have done, too. Och! and may the
blessed Vargin pity me, for I never’ll be
cured of my graneness!”</p>

<h4>THE MAN WHO HAS ALL DISEASES AT ONCE.</h4>

<p>Imitate the cough. Put your hands on different parts of your body in
describing your aches and pains. Wear a long dismal face. Bend forward
and limp as you change your position.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Good Morning, Doctor; how do
you do? I hain’t quite as well as
I have been; but I think I’m some
better than I was. I don’t think that last
medicine that you gin me did me much
good. I had a terrible time with the earache
last night; my wife got up and drapt a
few draps of walnut sap into it, and that relieved
it some; but I didn’t get a wink of
sleep till nearly daylight. For nearly a
week, Doctor, I’ve had the worst kind of a
narvous headache; it has been so bad sometimes
that I thought my head would bust
open. Oh, dear! I sometimes think that I’m
the most afflictedest human that ever lived.</p>

<p>Since this cold weather sot in, that troublesome
cough, that I have had every winter
for the last fifteen years, has began to pester
me agin. (<i>Coughs.</i>) Doctor, do you think
you can give me any thing that will relieve
this desprit pain I have in my side?</p>

<p>Then I have a crick, at times, in the back of
my neck, so that I can’t turn my head without
turning the hull of my body. (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, dear! What shall I do? I have consulted
almost every doctor in the country,
but they don’t any of them seem to understand
my case. I have tried everything that
I could think of; but I can’t find anything
that does me the least good. (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, this cough—it will be the death of me
yet! You know I had my right hip put out
last fall at the rising of Deacon Jones’ saw-mill;
it’s getting to be very troublesome just
before we have a change of weather. Then
I’ve got the sciatica in my right knee, and
sometimes I’m so crippled up that I can
hardly crawl round in any fashion.</p>

<p>What do you think that old white mare of
ours did while I was out plowing last week?
Why, the weaked old critter, she kept a backing
and backing, ontil she backed me right
up agin the colter, and knock’d a piece of
skin off my shin nearly so big. (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>But I had a worse misfortune than that the
other day, Doctor. You see it was washing-day—and
my wife wanted me to go out and
bring in a little stove-wood—you know we lost
our help lately, and my wife has to wash and
tend to everything about the house herself.</p>

<p>I knew it wouldn’t be safe for me to go
out—as it was raining at the time—but I
thought I’d risk it anyhow. So I went out,
picked up a few chunks of stove-wood, and
was a coming up the steps into the house,
when my feet slipped from under me, and I
fell down as sudden as if I’d been shot.
Some of the wood lit upon my face, broke
down the bridge of my nose, cut my upper
lip, and knocked out three of my front teeth.
I suffered dreadfully on account of it, as you
may suppose, and my face ain’t well enough
yet to make me fit to be seen, ’specially by
the women folks. (<i>Coughs.</i>) Oh, dear! but
that ain’t all, Doctor; I’ve got fifteen corns
on my toes—and I’m afeard I’m going to
have the “yaller janders.” (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<h4>THE DUTCHMAN’S SNAKE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="140" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Near the town of Reading, in Berks
County, Pennsylvania, there formerly
lived a well-to-do Dutch
farmer named Peter Van Riper. His only
son was a strapping lad of seventeen, also
named Peter, and upon old Peter and young
Peter devolved the principal cares of the old
man’s farm, now and then assisted by an ancient
Dutchman named Jake Sweighoffer,
who lived in the neighborhood, and went out
to work by the day.</p>

<p>One warm day in haying time this trio
were hard at work in a meadow near the
farm-house, when suddenly Peter the elder
dropped his scythe and called out:</p>

<p>“Oh! mine gracious, Peter! Peter!”</p>

<p>“What’s de matter, fader?” answered the
son, straightening up and looking at his
sire.</p>

<p>“Oh! mine Peter! Peter!” again cried the
old man, “do come here, right off! Der
schnake pite mine leg!”</p>

<p>If anything in particular could disturb the
nerves of young Peter, it was snakes; for he
had once been chased by a black one and
frightened nearly out of his wits. At the
word snake, therefore, young Van Riper fell
back, nimbly as a wire-drawer, and called
out in turn: “Where is der shnake, fader?”</p>

<p>“Here, up mine preeches!—Oh! my! my!
my!”</p>

<p>“Vy don’t you kill him, fader?” exclaimed
Peter, junior, keeping at a safe distance from
his suffering sire.</p>

<p>“I can’t get at der little sinner, Peter; you
come dake off my drowsis, or he’ll kill me
mit his pites.”</p>

<p>But the fears of Peter, the younger, overcame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
his filial affection, and lent strength to
his legs, for he started off like a scared two-year-old
toward the old man Jake, to call him
to the assistance of his unhappy father. A
few moments after, the two came bounding
toward the old man, and as they passed a
haycock where their garments had been laid
when they began work, Jake grabbed the
vest which he supposed belonged to his employer.
During this time old Peter had
managed to keep on his feet, although he
was quaking and trembling like an aspen
leaf in a June gale of wind.</p>

<p>“Oh! come quick, Yacob!” exclaimed he,
“he pite like sixty, here, on mine leg.”</p>

<p>Old Jake was not particularly sensitive to
fear, but few people, young or old, are free
from alarm when a “pizenous” reptile is
about. He seized a small pitchfork, and,
telling the unhappy Van Riper to stand
steady, promised to stun the reptile by a rap
or two, even if he didn’t kill it outright. The
frightened old man did not long hesitate between
the risk of a broken leg or being bitten
to death by a snake, but promptly indicated
the place where Jake should strike.
Whack went the pitchfork, and down tumbled
Peter, exclaiming, “Oh! my! my! my;
I pleeve you’ve proke mine leg! but den der
shnake’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Vere! vere’s he gone to?” says old
Sweighoffer, looking sharply about on the
ground he stood upon.</p>

<p>“Never mind der shnake now, Yacob,”
says Van Riper, “come and help me up, and
I’ll go home.”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ve got your shacket—put it on,”
says Jacob, lifting up the old man, and
slipping his arms into the armholes of the
vest.</p>

<p>The moment old Peter made the effort to
get the garment on his shoulders, he grew
livid in the face—his hair stood on end—he
shivered and shook—his teeth chattered, and
his knees knocked an accompaniment. “O
Yacob!” exclaimed he, “help me to go home—I’m
dead! I’m dead!”</p>

<p>“Vat’s dat you say? Ish dere nodder
shnake in your preeches?” inquired the intrepid
Jacob.</p>

<p>“Not dat—I don’t mean dat,” says the
farmer, “but shust you look on me—I’m
shwelt all up, pigger as an ox! my shacket
won’t go on my pack. I’m dying mit de
pizen. Oh! oh! oh! help me home quick.”</p>

<p>The hired man came to the same conclusion;
and with might and main he hurried
old Peter along toward the farm-house.
Meantime young Peter had run home, and so
alarmed the women folks that they were in a
high state of excitement when they saw the
approach of the good old man and his
assistant.</p>

<p>Old man Peter was carried into the house,
laid on a bed, and began to lament his sad
misfortune in a most grievous manner, when
the old lady, his frow, came forward and
proposed to examine the bitten leg. The
unhappy man opened his eyes and feebly
pointed out the place of the bite. She carefully
ripped up his pantaloons, and out fell—a
thistle-top! and at the same time a considerable
scratch was made visible.</p>

<p>“Call dis a shnake? Bah!” says the old
lady, holding up the thistle.</p>

<p>“Oh! but I’m pizened to death, Katreen!—see,
I’m all pizen!—mine shacket!—Oh!
dear, mine shacket not come over mine
pody!”</p>

<p>“Haw! haw! you crazy fellow,” roars the
frow, “dat’s not your shacket—dat’s Peter’s
shacket! ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Vat! dat Peter’s shacket?” says old
Peter, shaking off death’s icy fetters at one
surge, and jumping up: “Bosh! Jacob, vat
an old fool you must be to say I vas shnake-pite!
Go ’pout your pusiness, gals. Peter,
give me mine pipe.”</p>

<h4>THE FRECKLE-FACED GIRL.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="140" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Ma’s up stairs changing her dress,”
said the freckled-faced little
girl, tying her doll’s bonnet
strings and casting her eye about for a tidy
large enough to serve as a shawl for that
double-jointed young person.</p>

<p>“Oh, your mother needn’t dress up for
me,” replied the female agent of the missionary
society, taking a self-satisfied view
of herself in the mirror. “Run up and tell
her to come down just as she is in her everyday
clothes, and not stand on ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but she hasn’t got on her everyday
clothes. Ma was all dressed up in her new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
brown silk dress, ’cause she expected Miss
Dimmond to-day. Miss Dimmond always
comes over here to show off her nice things,
and ma doesn’t mean to get left. When ma
saw you coming she said, ‘the dickens!’ and
I guess she was mad about something. Ma
said if you saw her new dress, she’d have to
hear all about the poor heathen, who don’t
have silk, and you’d ask her for money to
buy hymn books to send ’em. Say, do the
nigger ladies use hymn-book leaves to do
their hair up on and make it frizzy? Ma
says she guesses that’s all the good the books
do ’em, if they ever get any books. I wish
my doll was a heathen.”</p>

<p>“Why, you wicked little girl! what do
you want of a heathen doll?” inquired the
missionary lady, taking a mental inventory
of the new things in the parlor to get material
for a homily on worldly extravagance.</p>

<p>“So folks would send her lots of nice things
to wear, and feel sorry to have her going
about naked. Then she’d have her hair to
frizz, and I want a doll with truly hair and
eyes that roll up like Deacon Silderback’s
when he says amen on Sunday. I ain’t a
wicked girl, either, ’cause Uncle Dick—you
know Uncle Dick, he’s been out West and
swears awful and smokes in the house—he
says I’m a holy terror, and he hopes I’ll be
an angel pretty soon. Ma’ll be down in a
minute, so you needn’t take your cloak off.
She said she’d box my ears if I asked you to.</p>

<p>“Ma’s putting on that old dress she had
last year, ’cause she didn’t want you to
think she was able to give much this time,
and she needed a muff worse than the queen
of the cannon-ball islands needed ’ligion.
Uncle Dick says you oughter get to the
islands, ’cause you’d be safe there, and the
natives would be sorry they was such sinners
anybody would send you to ’em. He
says he never seen a heathen hungry enough
to eat you, ’less it was a blind one, an’ you’d
set a blind pagan’s teeth on edge so he’d
never hanker after any more missionary.
Uncle Dick’s awful funny, and makes ma
and pa die laughing sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Your Uncle Richard is a bad, depraved
wretch, and ought to have remained out
West, where his style is appreciated. He sets
a horrid example for little girls like you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he’s nice. He showed me
how to slide down the banisters, and he’s
teaching me to whistle when ma ain’t around.
That’s a pretty cloak you’ve got, ain’t it?
Do you buy all your clothes with missionary
money? Ma says you do.”</p>

<p>Just then the freckle-faced little girl’s ma
came into the parlor and kissed the missionary
lady on the cheek and said she was delighted
to see her, and they proceeded to
have a real sociable chat. The little girl’s
ma cannot understand why a person who
professes to be so charitable as the missionary
agent does should go right over to Miss
Dimmond’s and say such ill-natured things
as she did, and she thinks the missionary is
a double-faced gossip. The little girl understands
it better than her ma does.</p>

<h4>THAT HIRED GIRL.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">When she came to work for the family
on Congress street, the lady of
the house sat down and told her
that agents, picture-sellers, peddlers, ragmen,
and all that class of people must be met
at the front door and coldly repulsed, and
Sarah said she’d repulse them if she had to
break every broomstick in town.</p>

<p>And she did. She threw the door open
wide, bluffed right up at ’em, and when she
got through talking, the cheekiest agent was
only too glad to leave. It got so after a
while that peddlers marked that house, and
the door-bell never rang except for company.</p>

<p>The other day, as the girl of the house was
wiping off the spoons, the bell rang. She
hastened to the door, expecting to see a lady,
but her eyes encountered a slim man, dressed
in black and wearing a white necktie. He
was the new minister, and was going around
to get acquainted with the members of his
flock, but Sarah wasn’t expected to know
this.</p>

<p>“Ah—um—is—Mrs.—ah!”</p>

<p>“Git!” exclaimed Sarah, pointing to the
gate.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, but I would like to see—see—!”</p>

<p>“Meander!” she shouted, looking around
for a weapon; “we don’t want any flour-sifters
here!”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken,” he replied, smiling
blandly. “I called to—”</p>

<p>“Don’t want anything to keep moths
away—fly!” exclaimed Sarah, getting red in
the face.</p>

<p>“Is the lady in?” he inquired, trying to
look over Sarah’s head.</p>

<p>“Yes, the lady is in, and I’m in, and you
are out!” she snapped; “and now I don’t
want to stand here talking to a fly-trap agent
any longer! Come lift your boots!”</p>

<p>“I’m not an agent,” he said, trying to
smile. “I’m the new—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you—you are the new man
with the patent flat-iron, but we don’t want any,
and you’d better go before I call the dog!”</p>

<p>“Will you give the lady my card, and say
that I called?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t; we are bored to death with
cards and handbills and circulars. Come, I
can’t stand here all day.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know that I was a minister?” he
asked, as he backed off.</p>

<p>“No, nor I don’t know it now; you look
like the man who sold the woman next door
a ten cent chromo for two dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“But here is my card.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for cards, I tell you! If you
leave that gate open, I will have to fling a
flower-pot at you!”</p>

<p>“I will call again,” he said, as he went
through the gate.</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good!” she shouted
after him; “we don’t want no prepared food
for infants—no piano music—no stuffed
birds! I know the policeman on this beat,
and if you come around here again, he’ll soon
find out whether you are a confidence man
or vagrant!”</p>

<p>And she took unusual care to lock the door.</p>

<h4>A REMARKABLE CASE OF S’POSIN.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A man hobbled into the Colonel’s
office upon crutches. Proceeding to
a chair and making a cushion of
some newspapers, he sat down
very gingerly, placed a bandaged leg upon
another chair, and said:</p>

<p>“Col. Coffin, my name is Briggs. I want
to get your opinion about a little point of
law. Now, Colonel, s’posin’ you lived up
the pike here a half mile, next door to a man
named Johnson. And s’posin’ you and Johnson
was to get into an argument about the
human intellect, and you was to say to Johnson
that a splendid illustration of the superiority
of the human intellect was to be found
in the power of the human eye to restrain the
ferocity of a wild animal. And s’posin’ Johnson
was to remark that that was all bosh,
because nobody <i>could</i> hold a wild animal
with the human eye, and you should declare
that you could hold the savagest beast that
was ever born if you could once fix your
gaze on him.</p>

<p>“Well, then, s’posin’ Johnson was to say
he’d bet a hundred dollars he could bring a
tame animal that you couldn’t hold with your
eye, and you was to take him up on it, and
Johnson was to ask you to come down to his
place to settle the bet. You’d go, we’ll say,
and Johnson’d wander round to the back of
the house and pretty soon come front again
with a dog bigger’n any four decent dogs
ought to be. And then s’posin’ Johnson’d
let go of that dog and set him on you, and
he’d come at you like a sixteen-inch shell out
of a howitzer, and you’d get scary about it
and try to hold the dog with your eye and
couldn’t.</p>

<p>“And s’posin’ you’d suddenly conclude
that maybe your kind of an eye wasn’t calculated
to hold that kind of a dog, and you’d
conclude to run for a plum tree in order to
have a chance to collect your thoughts and
to try to reflect what sort of an eye would be
best calculated to mollify that sort of a dog.
You ketch my idea, of course?</p>

<p>“Very well, then; s’posin’ you’d take
your eye off of that dog—Johnson, mind you,
all the time hissing him on and laughing, and
you’d turn and rush for the tree, and begin
to swarm up as fast as you could. Well, sir,
s’posin’ just as you got three feet from the
ground Johnson’s dog would grab you by
the leg and hold on like a vise, shaking you
until you nearly lost your hold.</p>

<p>“And s’posin’ Johnson was to stand there
and holloa, ‘Fix your eye on him, Briggs!
Why don’t you manifest the power of the
human intellect?’ and so on, howling out
ironical remarks like those; and s’posin’ he
kept that dog on that leg until he made you
swear to pay the bet, and then at last had to
pry the dog off with a hot poker, bringing
away at the same time some of your flesh in
the dog’s mouth, so that you had to be carried
home on a stretcher, and to hire several
doctors to keep you from dying with lock-jaw.</p>

<p>“S’posin’ this, what I want to know is,
couldn’t you sue Johnson for damages and
make him pay heavily for what that dog did?
That’s what I want to get at.”</p>

<p>The Colonel thought for a moment, and
then said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Briggs, I don’t think I could.
If I agreed to let Johnson set the dog at me,
I should be a party to the transaction, and I
could not recover.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that the law won’t
make that infernal scoundrel Johnson suffer
for letting his dog eat me up?”</p>

<p>“I think not, if you state the case properly.”</p>

<p>“It won’t, hey?” exclaimed Mr. Briggs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
hysterically. “Oh, very well, very well! I
s’pose if that dog had chewed me all up it’d
’ve been all the same to this constitutional
republic. But hang me if I don’t have satisfaction.
I’ll kill Johnson, poison his dog,
and emigrate to some country where the
rights of citizens are protected!”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Briggs got on his crutches and
hobbled out. He is still a citizen, and will
vote at the next election.</p>

<h4>HUNTING A MOUSE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I was dozing comfortably in my easy-chair,
and dreaming of the good times
which I hope are coming, when there
fell upon my ears a most startling scream.
It was the voice of my Maria Ann in agony.
The voice came from the kitchen, and to the
kitchen I rushed. The idolized form of my
Maria was perched on a chair, and she was
flourishing an iron spoon in all directions
and shouting “shoo,” in a general manner,
at everything in the room. To my anxious
inquiries as to what was the matter, she
screamed, “O Joshua! a mouse, shoo—wha—shoo—a
great—ya—shoo—horrid mouse,
and—she—ew—it ran right out of the cupboard—shoo—go
way—O Lord—Joshua—shoo—kill
it, oh, my—shoo.”</p>

<p>All that fuss, you see, about one little
harmless mouse. Some women are so afraid
of mice. Maria is. I got the poker and set
myself to poke that mouse, and my wife
jumped down and ran off into another room.
I found the mouse in a corner under the
sink. The first time I hit it I didn’t poke it
any on account of getting the poker all
tangled up in a lot of dishes in the sink; and
I did not hit it any more because the mouse
would not stay still. It ran right toward
me, and I naturally jumped, as anybody
would; but I am not afraid of mice, and when
the horrid thing ran up inside the leg of my
pantaloons, I yelled to Maria because I was
afraid it would gnaw a hole in my garment.</p>

<p>I did not lose my presence of mind for an
instant. I caught the mouse just as it was
clambering over my knee, and by pressing
firmly on the outside of the cloth, I kept the
animal a prisoner on the inside. I kept
jumping around with all my might to confuse
it, so that it would not think about biting,
and I yelled so that the mice would not
hear its squeaks and come to its assistance.
A man can’t handle many mice at once to
advantage. Besides, I’m not so spry as I was
before I had that spine in my back and had
to wear plasters.</p>

<p>Maria was white as a sheet when she came
into the kitchen and asked what she should
do—as though I could hold the mouse and
plan a campaign at the same time. I told
her to think of something, and she thought
she would throw things at the intruder; but
as there was no earthly chance for her to hit
the mouse, while every shot took effect on
me, I told her to stop, after she had tried two
flat-irons and the coal-scuttle. She paused
for breath; but I kept bobbing around.
Somehow I felt no inclination to sit down
anywhere. “O Joshua,” she cried, “I wish
you had not killed the cat.”</p>

<p>Then she got the tea-kettle and wanted to
scald the mouse. I objected to that process,
except as a last resort. Then she got some
cheese to coax the mouse down, but I did
not dare to let go, for fear it would run up.
Matters were getting desperate. I told her
to think of something else, and I kept jumping.
Just as I was ready to faint with exhaustion,
I tripped over an iron, lost my
hold, and the mouse fell to the floor, very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
dead. I had no idea a mouse could be
squeezed to death so easy.</p>

<p>That was not the end of the trouble, for
before I had recovered my breath a fireman
broke in one of the front windows, and a
whole company followed him through, and
they dragged hose around, and mussed
things all over the house, and then the foreman
wanted to thrash me because the house
was not on fire, and I had hardly got him
pacified before a policeman came in and arrested
me. Some one had run down and
told him I was drunk and was killing Maria.
It was all Maria and I could do, by combining
our eloquence, to prevent him from
marching me off in disgrace, but we finally
got matters quieted and the house clear.</p>

<h4>THE VILLAGE SEWING SOCIETY.</h4>

<p>This is a very amusing recitation when correctly rendered. The gossips
make the most disparaging remarks about their neighbors, but are very
pleasant to their faces. The words in parentheses should be spoken
‘aside’ in an undertone. A recital for one who can imitate different
female voices.</p>

<h4>A BIG MISTAKE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-r.jpg" width="130" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Recently our church had a new
minister. He is a nice, good, sociable
gentleman; but coming
from a distant State, of course he
was totally unacquainted with our people.
Therefore it happened that during his pastoral
calls, he made several ludicrous blunders.
One as follows: The other evening
he called upon Mrs. Haddon. She had just
lost her husband, and she naturally supposed
that his visit was relative to the sad occurrence.
So, after a few common-places had
been exchanged, she was not surprised to
hear him remark:</p>

<p>“It was a sad bereavement, was it not,
Mrs. Haddon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” faltered the widow.</p>

<p>“Totally unexpected?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I never dreamed of it.”</p>

<p>“He died in the barn, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; in the house.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I suppose you must have
thought a great deal of him?”</p>

<p>“Of course, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>This was with vim. The minister looked
rather surprised, crossed his legs and renewed
the conversation.</p>

<p>“Blind staggers was the disease, I believe.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” snapped the widow. “Apoplexy.”</p>

<p>“Indeed; you must have fed him too
much.”</p>

<p>“He was quite capable of feeding himself,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Very intelligent he must have been.
Died hard?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“You had to hit him on the head with an
axe to put him out of his misery, I am
told.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Haddon’s eyes snapped fire.</p>

<p>“Whoever told you that did not speak
the truth,” she haughtily uttered. “James
died naturally.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the minister, in a perplexed
tone. “He kicked the side of the
barn down in his last agonies, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; he did not.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have been misinformed, I suppose.
How old was he?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-five.”</p>

<p>“He did not do much active work. Perhaps
you are better without him, for you can
easily supply his place with a better one.”</p>

<p>“<i>Never!</i> sir, will I find such a good one
as he.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you will; he had the heaves
bad, you know.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, I recollect I saw him one day,
with you on his back, and I distinctly recollect
that he had the heaves, and walked as if
he had the spring-halt.”</p>

<p>Mrs. H.’s eyes snapped fire, and she stared
at the reverend visitor as if she imagined he
was crazy.</p>

<p>“He could not have had the spring-halt,
for he had a cork-leg,” she replied.</p>

<p>“A cork-leg—remarkable; but really,
didn’t he have a dangerous trick of suddenly
stopping and kicking the wagon all to
pieces?”</p>

<p>“Never, sir; he was not mad.”</p>

<p>“Probably not. But there were some good
points about him.”</p>

<p>“I should think so.”</p>

<p>“The way in which he carried his ears, for
example.”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever noticed that particular
merit,” said the widow, with much asperity,
“he was warm-hearted, generous and frank.”</p>

<p>“Good qualities,” answered the minister.
“How long did it take him to go a mile?”</p>

<p>“About fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Not much of a goer. Wasn’t his hair
apt to fly?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t have any hair, he was bald-headed.”</p>

<p>“Quite a curiosity.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; no more of a curiosity than you
are.”</p>

<p>The minister shifted uneasily, and got red
in the face; but he returned to the attack.</p>

<p>“Did you use the whip much on him?”</p>

<p>“Never, sir.”</p>

<p>“Went right along without it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He must have been a good sort of a
<i>brute</i>!”</p>

<p>The widow sat down and cried.</p>

<p>“The idea of your coming here and insulting
me,” she sobbed. “If my husband
had lived you would not have done it. Your
remarks in reference to the poor dead man
have been a series of insults, and I won’t
stand it.”</p>

<p>He colored, and looked dumfounded.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you Mrs. Blinkers?” at last he
stammered, “and has not your gray horse
just died?”</p>

<p>“No! no!” she cried. “I never owned a
horse, but my husband died a week ago.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later that minister came out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
of that house with the reddest face ever seen
on mortal man.</p>

<p>“And to think,” he groaned, as he strode
home, “that I was talking horse to that
woman all the time—and she was talking
husband.”</p>

and if you interrupt, and throw them off the
track, they have to go back and begin over
again. All their lives long, they are employed
in showing strange things to foreigners
and listening to their bursts of admiration.</p>

<p>After we discovered this, we never went
into ecstasies any more, we never admired
anything, we never showed any but impassible
faces and stupid indifference in the presence
of the sublimest wonders a guide had
to display. We had found their weak point.
We made some of those people savage, at
times, but we never lost our serenity.</p>

<p>The doctor asked the questions generally,
because he can keep his countenance, and
look more like an inspired idiot, and throw
more imbecility into the tone of his voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
than any man that lives. It comes natural
to him.</p>

<p>The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure
an American party, because Americans
so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment
and emotion before any relic of Columbus.
Our guide there fidgeted about as if
he had swallowed a spring mattress. He was
full of animation—full of impatience. He
said:</p>

<p>“Come wis me, genteelmen!—come! I
show you ze letter writing by Christopher
Colombo!—write it himself!—write it wis
his own hand!—come!”</p>

<p>He took us to the municipal palace. After
much impressive fumbling of keys and opening
of locks, the stained and aged document
was spread before us. The guide’s eyes
sparkled. He danced about us and tapped
the parchment with his finger.</p>

<p>“What I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not
so? See! handwriting Christopher Colombo!—write
it himself!”</p>

<p>We looked indifferent, unconcerned. The
doctor examined the document very deliberately,
during a painful pause. Then he said,
without any show of interest,</p>

<p>“Ah—what—what did you say was the
name of the party who wrote this?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher
Colombo!”</p>

<p>Another deliberate examination.</p>

<p>“Ah—did he write it himself, or—or how?”</p>

<p>“He write it himself!—Christopher Colombo!
he’s own handwriting, write by himself!”</p>

<p>Then the doctor laid the document down,
and said,</p>

<p>“Why, I have seen boys in America only
fourteen years old that could write better
than that.”</p>

<p>“But zis is ze great Christo—”</p>

<p>“I don’t care who it is! It’s the worst
writing I ever saw. Now you mustn’t think
you can impose on us because we are strangers.
We are not fools, by a good deal. If
you have got any specimens of penmanship of
real merit, trot them out!—and if you haven’t,
drive on!”</p>

<p>We drove on. The guide was considerably
shaken up, but he made one more venture.
He had something which he thought would
overcome us. He said,</p>

<p>“Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me! I
show you beautiful, oh, magnificent bust
Christopher Colombo—splendid, grand, magnificent!”</p>

<p>He brought us before the beautiful bust—for
it <i>was</i> beautiful—and sprang back and
struck an attitude:</p>

<p>“Ah, look, genteelmen!—beautiful, grand—bust
Christopher Colombo!—beautiful bust,
beautiful pedestal!”</p>

<p>The doctor put up his eye-glass—procured
for such occasions:</p>

<p>“Ah—what did you say this gentleman’s
name was?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher
Colombo!”</p>

<p>“Christopher Colombo—the great Christopher
Colombo. Well, what did <i>he</i> do?”</p>

<p>“Discover America!—discover America,
oh, ze devil!”</p>

<p>“Discover America? No—that statement
will hardly wash. We are just from America
ourselves. We heard nothing about it.
Christopher Colombo—pleasant name—is—is
he dead?”</p>

<p>“Oh, corpo di Baccho!—three hundred
year!”</p>

<p>“What did he die of?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“Small-pox, think?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, genteelmen—I do not
know <i>what</i> he died of.”</p>

<p>“Measles, likely?”</p>

<p>“Maybe—maybe. I do <i>not</i> know—I think
he die of something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“Parents living?”</p>

<p>“Im-possible!”</p>

<p>“Ah—which is the bust and which is the
pedestal?”</p>

<p>“Santa Maria!—<i>zis</i> ze bust!—<i>zis</i> ze pedestal!”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see, I see—happy combination—very
happy combination indeed. Is—is this
the first time this gentleman was ever on a
bust?”</p>

<p>That joke was lost on the foreigner; guides
cannot master the subtleties of the American
joke.</p>

<p>We have made it interesting for this Roman
guide. Yesterday we spent three or four
hours in the Vatican again, that wonderful
world of curiosities. We came very near
expressing interest sometimes, even admiration.
It was hard to keep from it. We succeeded,
though. Nobody else ever did, in
the Vatican museums. The guide was bewildered,
nonplussed. He walked his legs
off, nearly, hunting up extraordinary things,
and exhausted all his ingenuity on us, but it
was a failure; we never showed any interest
in anything. He had reserved what he considered
to be his greatest wonder till the last—a
royal Egyptian mummy, the best preserved
in the world, perhaps. He took us
there. He felt so sure, this time, that some
of his old enthusiasm came back to him:</p>

<p>“See, genteelmen!—Mummy! Mummy!”</p>

<p>The eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately
as ever.</p>

<p>“Ah—what did I understand you to say
the gentleman’s name was?”</p>

<p>“Name?—he got no name!—Mummy!—’Gyptian
mummy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Born here?”</p>

<p>“No. <i>’Gyptian</i> mummy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, just so. Frenchman, I presume?”</p>

<p>“No!—<i>not</i> Frenchman, not Roman!—born
in Egypta!”</p>

<p>“Born in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta
before. Foreign locality, likely. Mummy—mummy.
How calm he is, how self-possessed!
Is—ah—is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>sacre bleu</i>! been dead three thousan’
year!”</p>

<p>The doctor turned on him, savagely:</p>

<p>“Here, now, what do you mean by such
conduct as this? Playing us for Chinamen
because we are strangers and trying to learn!
Trying to impose your vile second-hand carcasses
on <i>us</i>! Thunder and lightning! I’ve
a notion to—to—if you’ve got a nice <i>fresh</i>
corpse, fetch him out!—or, by George, we’ll
brain you!”</p>

<h4>AUNT POLLY’S “GEORGE WASHINGTON.”</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“George Washin’ton!”</p>

<p>From down the hill the answer
floated up, muffled by the distance.</p>

<p>“Ma’m?”</p>

<p>“Come heah, sah!”</p>

<p>Aunt Polly folded her arms and leaned
against the doorway and waited for the appearance
of her son and heir above the edge
of the hill on which her cabin stood.</p>

<p>“George Washin’ton,” she said, “you sartainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
is de laziest nigger I eber see. How,
long, sah, does you s’pose you was a-comin’
up dat hill? You don’ no? I don’ nether;
’twas so long I los’ all count. You’ll bring
yore mudder’s gray har in sorrer to de grabe
yet, wid yore pokin’ and slowness, see if you
don’. Heah I is waitin’ and a’waitin’ on you
for to go down to ole Mass’ Cunningham’s
wid dose tings. Take ’em to de young city
man boardin’ dar, and tell him dese is his
clean close dat yore old mudder washed, and
dat dey comes to fifty cents. And if you let
de grass grow under yore feet, George Washin’ton,
or spiles dese close, or loses dat fifty
cents, I’ll break yore bones, chile, when you
comes home. You heah dat?”</p>

<p>George Washington rested his basket on
his hip and jogged along. Meditations as to
what his mother might have for supper on
the strength of the fifty cents brightened his
visage and accelerated his steps. His fancy
revelled in visions of white biscuit and crisp
bacon floating in its own grease. He was
gravely weighing the relative merits of spring
chicken fried and more elderly chicken
stewed, when—</p>

<p>There was only one muddy place on
George Washington’s route to town; that
was down at the foot of the hill, by the railroad
track. Why should his feet slip from
under him, and he go sliding into the mud
right there? It was too bad. It did not
hurt him, but those shirts and shining collars,
alas! Some of them tumbled out, and he
lifted them up all spattered and soiled.</p>

<p>He sat down and contemplated the situation
with an expression of speechless solemnity.
He was afraid to go back, and he was
afraid to go on, but he would rather face the
“city man” than his mother; and with a
sigh that nearly burst the twine string that
did duty as a suspender, he lifted the linen
into its place and trudged on.</p>

<p>The young folks at “Mass’ Cunningham’s”
sent him to the boarder’s room, with many a
jest on his slowness, and he shook in his
ragged clothes when the young man lifted
the things from the basket to put them
away.</p>

<p>He exclaimed in anger at their soiled appearance,
and, of course, immediately bundled
them back into the basket.</p>

<p>“Here, George,” he said, “take these
back to your mother to wash, and don’t you
dare, you little vagabond! ever bring such
looking things to me again.”</p>

<p>Slowly the namesake of our illustrious
countryman climbed the hill toward home;
slowly he entered and set down his basket.
The rapidity with which he emerged from
the door, about three minutes later, might
have led a stranger to believe that it was a
different boy. But it was not. It was the
same George.</p>

<p>The next afternoon came around, and
George Washington again departed on his
errand. No thoughts of supper or good
things ran rife in his brain to-day. He attended
strictly to business. His mother,
standing in the door-way, called after him:
“Be keerful, George Washin’ton, ’bout de
train. I heer’d it at de upper junction jess
now. It’ll be long trectly.”</p>

<p>George Washington nodded and disappeared.
He crossed the muddy place in safety,
and breathed more freely. He was turning toward
town, when something on the railroad
track caught his eye. There lay the big
rock that had been on the hill above ever
since he could remember; it was right in the
track. He wondered how the coming train
would get over it.</p>

<p>Across on the other side, the hill sloped
down to a deep ravine. What if the big
rock pushed the train off! His heart gave a
great jump. He had heard them talk of an
accident once, where many people were
killed. He thought of running to tell somebody,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
but it was a good way to the next
house, and just then he heard the train faintly;
it was too late for that. Just above, in
the direction that the train was coming, was
a sharp curve. It could not stop if it came
tearing round that, and on the other side of
the bend was a very high trestle that made
him sick to look at.</p>

<p>The slow, dull boy stood and trembled.</p>

<p>In a moment more he had set his basket carefully
in the bush, and ran around the curve.
At the edge of the trestle he paused, and then
dropping on his hands and knees, crept as fast
as he could over the dizzy height to the other
side. He staggered to his feet, and ran on.</p>

<p>When the train dashed in sight, the engineer
spied a small object on the track,
pointing frantically behind him. The child
ran away from the track, but continued to
wave and point and shout “Stop!”</p>

<p>The train whistled and slackened. George
Washington, hatless and breathless, was
jerked into the engine, where he gasped, “Big
rock on de track round de curve.” The train
was moved slowly over the trestle and stopped
in the curve, and there, indeed, was the rock
that might have hurled them all down to death,
but for that ridiculous-looking little boy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the cabin, Aunt Polly was
restless, and concluded to go down to the
foot of the hill, and wait for George Washington.
Behold, then, as she appeared down
the path, the sight that met her gaze.</p>

<p>“What’s dis boy bin a-doin’! I’se his
mother. I is. What’s dis mean?”</p>

<p>On this identical train was the president of
the road.</p>

<p>“Why, auntie,” he said, “you have a boy
to be proud of. He crept over the high
trestle and warned the train, and maybe
saved all our lives. He is a hero.”</p>

<p>Aunt Polly was dazed.</p>

<p>“A hearo,” she said; “dat’s a big t’ing for
a little black nigger. George Washin’ton,
whar’s dat basket?”</p>

<p>“In de bushes, mammy; I’se gwine for to
get it.”</p>

<p>The train was nearly ready to be off. The
president called Aunt Polly aside, and she
came back with a beaming face, and five ten-dollar
bills clutched in her hands.</p>

<p>Aunt Polly caught George in her arms.</p>

<p>“Dey sed you was a hearo, George Washin’ton,
but you is yore mammy’s own boy,
and you shall hab chicken for yore supper
dis berry night, and a whole poun’ cake to-morrow,
yes, you shall!”</p>

<p>And when George Washington returned
the gentleman his washing, he, like his namesake,
was a hero.</p>

<h4>THE MINISTER’S CALL.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Rev. Mr. Mulkittle having successfully
organized a church fair, was a
very happy man. It had been hinted
that the congregation were a “little short”
on raising the reverend gentleman’s salary,
hence the proceeds of the fair would more
than supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The good man, after retiring from a profitable
afternoon’s work, during which he
had assured dyspeptics that potato salad
would not hurt them, seated himself by the
library fire, when the “youngest” entered.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, pa?”</p>

<p>“To the fair.”</p>

<p>“What fair?”</p>

<p>“Our church fair.”</p>

<p>“Did they have it out to the fair
grounds?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where then?”</p>

<p>“Down town in our church.”</p>

<p>“Did they have horses and cows?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! they didn’t show anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did they do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they sold toys and something for
people to eat.”</p>

<p>“Did they sell it to the poor?”</p>

<p>“They sold it to anybody who had money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! it was the feast of the passover,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mulkittle took up a newspaper and
began to read.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to be a preacher, pa?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if the Lord calls you.”</p>

<p>“Did the Lord call you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What did He say?”</p>

<p>“Told me to go and preach the gospel to
every living creature.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t tell you to preach to niggers, did
He?”</p>

<p>“That’ll do now.”</p>

<p>“You thought the Lord had called you
again the other day, did you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are talking about,”
said the minister.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know the other day you told
ma you had a call to go to some place, and
you would go if you could get two hundred
dollars more. Wouldn’t the Lord give you
the two hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you to hush, sir?” said the
minister, throwing down his paper and glaring
at his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir; you told me to behave myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, see that you do.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me—”</p>

<p>“Tell you what?”</p>

<p>“’Bout the call.”</p>

<p>“Well, a church in another town wanted
me to come there and preach.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t afford it. They didn’t pay
enough money.”</p>

<p>“Call wasn’t loud enough, was it?”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly,” asserted Mr. Mulkittle,
with a smile. “It wasn’t loud enough to be
very interesting.”</p>

<p>“If it had been louder, would you went?”</p>

<p>“I should have gone if they had offered
me more money.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the Lord that called you that
time then, was it?”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“How much money did the Lord offer
you?”</p>

<p>“Do you see that door?”</p>

<p>“No sir; which door?”</p>

<p>“That one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, go out and shut it.”</p>

<p>“I want to stay in here.”</p>

<p>“You cannot.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you are too foolishly inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“What’s foolish ’quisitive?”</p>

<p>“Asking so many questions.”</p>

<p>“How many must I ask?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Then I couldn’t talk, could I?”</p>

<p>“It would be better for you, if you couldn’t
talk so much.”</p>

<p>“How much must I talk?”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll give you ten cents now, if
you’ll go away and hush.”</p>

<p>“Call ain’t strong enough,” said the boy,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a quarter,” said the preacher,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Call is strong enough; I’ll go.”</p>

<h4>HOW HEZEKIAH STOLE THE SPOONS.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In a quiet little Ohio village, many years
ago, was a tavern where the stages
always changed, and the passengers
expected to get breakfast. The landlord of
the said hotel was noted for his tricks upon
travelers, who were allowed to get fairly
seated at the table, when the driver would
blow his horn (after taking his “horn”), and
sing out, “Stage ready, gentlemen!”—whereupon
the passengers were obliged to hurry
out to take their seats, leaving a scarcely
tasted breakfast behind them, for which, however,
they had to pay over fifty cents! One
day, when the stage was approaching the
house of this obliging landlord, a passenger
said that he had often heard of the landlord’s
trick, and he was afraid they would not be
able to eat any breakfast.</p>

<p>“What!—how? No breakfast!” exclaimed
the rest.</p>

<p>“Exactly so gents, and you may as well
keep your seats and tin.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they expect passengers to breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes! they expect you to it, but not
to eat it. I am under the impression that
there is an understanding between the landlord
and the driver that for sundry and
various drinks, etc., the latter starts before
you can scarcely commence eating.”</p>

<p>“What on airth are you all talking about?
Ef you calkelate I’m going to pay four and
ninepence for my breakfast, and not get the
valee on’t you’re mistaken,” said a voice from
a back seat, the owner of which was one
Hezekiah Spaulding—though “tew hum”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
they call him “Hez” for short. “I’m goin’
to get my breakfast here, and not pay nary
red cent till I do.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll be left.”</p>

<p>“Not as you knows on, I guess I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” said the other, as the
stage drove up to the door and the landlord
ready “to do the hospitable,” says—</p>

<p>“Breakfast just ready, gents! Take a
wash, gents? Here’s water, basins, towels,
and soap.”</p>

<p>After performing the ablutions, they all
proceeded to the dining-room, and commenced
a fierce onslaught upon the edibles,
though Hez took his time. Scarcely had
they tasted their coffee when they heard the
unwelcome sound of the horn, and the driver
exclaim, “Stage ready!” Up rise eight
grumbling passengers, pay their fifty cents,
and take their seats.</p>

<p>“All on board, gents?” inquires the host.</p>

<p>“One missing,” said they.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the dining-room the host
finds Hez very coolly helping himself to an
immense piece of steak, the size of a horse’s
hip.</p>

<p>“You’ll be left, sir! Stage going to
start.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I hain’t got nothin’ agin it,” drawls
out Hez.</p>

<p>“Can’t wait, sir—better take your seat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be blowed ef I do, nother, till I’ve
got my breakfast! I paid for it, and I am
goin’ to get the valee on’t it; and ef you calkelate
I hain’t you are mistaken.”</p>

<p>So the stage did start, and left Hez, who
continued his attack upon the edibles. Biscuit,
coffee, etc., disappeared before the eyes
of the astonished landlord.</p>

<p>“Say, squire, them there cakes is ’bout eat—fetch
on another grist on ’em. You” (to
the waiter), “’nother cup of that ere coffee.
Pass them eggs. Raise your own pork,
squire? This is ’mazin’ nice ham. Land
’bout here tolerable cheap, squire? Hain’t
much maple timber in these parts, hev
ye? Dew right smart trade, squire, I calkelate?”
And thus Hez kept quizzing
the landlord until he had made a hearty
meal.</p>

<p>“Say, squire, now I’m ’bout to conclude
paying my devowers to this ere table, but
just give us a bowl of bread and milk to top
off with; I’d be much obleeged tew ye.”</p>

<p>So out go the landlord and waiter for the
bowl, milk, and bread, and set them before
him.</p>

<p>“Spoon, tew, ef you please.”</p>

<p>But no spoon could be found. Landlord
was sure he had plenty of silver ones lying
on the table when the stage stopped.</p>

<p>“Say, dew ye? dew ye think them passengers
is goin’ to pay ye for a breakfuss
and not git no compensashun?”</p>

<p>“Ah! what? Do you think any of the
passengers took them?”</p>

<p>“Dew I think? No, I don’t think, but
I’m sartin. Ef they are all as green as yew
bout here I’m going to locate immediately
and tew wonst.”</p>

<p>The landlord rushes out to the stable, and
starts a man off after the stage, which had
gone about three miles. The man overtakes
and says something to the driver in a low
tone. He immediately turns back, and on
arriving at the hotel Hez comes out, takes
his seat, and says:</p>

<p>“How are yew, gents? I’m glad to see
yew.”</p>

<p>“Can you point out the man you think
has the spoons?” asked the landlord.</p>

<p>“P’int him out? Sartenly I ken. Say,
squire, I paid yew four and ninepence for a
breakfuss, and I calkelate I got the valee
on’t it! You’ll find them spoons in the coffee-pot.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead! All aboard, driver.”</p>

<p>The landlord stared.</p>

<h4>HOW THEY SAID GOOD-NIGHT.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">They have had a long evening together
(three whole hours), but it doesn’t
seem more than five minutes to them.
Still, the inexorable clock is announcing the
hour of eleven in the most forcible and uncompromising
manner. He knows that he
ought to go, because he must be at the store
at seven in the morning; she fully realizes
that his immediate departure is necessary, for
has not her father threatened that he will
come down and “give that young Simpkins a
piece of his mind if he don’t leave by eleven
o’clock in the future?” They both understand
that the fatal hour has come, yet how
they hate to part!</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I <i>must</i> be going,” he
says, with a long, regretful sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you must,” she rejoins.</p>

<p>Then they gaze into each other’s eyes;
then she pillows her head upon his bosom;
then their lips meet, and he mentally swears
that if he can get his salary raised to eighteen
dollars a week he will make her Mrs. G. W.
Simpkins without further agonizing delay.</p>

<p>The clock looks on with a cynical expression
on its face. It is doing its duty, and if
old man Smith comes down stairs and destroys
the peace of mind of this loving couple,
it will not be its fault.</p>

<p>He asks her if she will not be happy when
the time comes that they will never, never
have to part, and she murmurs an affirmative
response. Then follow more kissing and
embracing. If G. W. Simpkins were told
now that he would ever come home to her at
2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> with fabulous tales of accidents by
flood and field, and on the Elevated Railroad,
would he believe it? No; a smile of incredulity
and scorn would wreathe his lips,
and he would forthwith clasp her to his
breast.</p>

<p>He knows that other men do such things,
but he is not that sort of man. Beside, he
will have the immense advantage over all
others of his sex in possessing the only absolutely
perfect specimen of femininity extant.
He thinks that he will never be happy anywhere
away from her side, and he tells her
so, and she believes him.</p>

<p>The clock does not announce the quarter-hour,
because it is not built that way, but,
nevertheless, it is now 11.15. They do not
imagine that it is later than 11.02. He asks
her if she ever loved any one else, and she
says “No;” and then he reminds her of a
certain Tom Johnson with whom she used to
go to the theatre, at which she becomes angry
and says that he (G. W. Simpkins) is a “real
mean thing.” Then G. W. S. arises with an
air of dignity, and says that he is much
obliged to her for her flattering opinion; and
she says that he is quite welcome.</p>

<p>Just then a heavy foot-fall is heard upstairs.
She glances at the clock, and perceives to
her dismay that it is 11.20. She had expected
to have a nice little quarrel, followed
by the usual reconciliation, but there is no
time for that now. She throws her arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
around his neck, and whispers in great agitation
that she believes pa is coming. G. W.
S. quakes inwardly, for her pa is about four
sizes larger than himself, and of a cruel, vindictive
nature. But he assumes an air of
bravado, and darkly hints at the extreme
probability that the room in which they stand
will be the scene of a sanguinary conflict in
the immediate future, should any one venture
to cross his path. Then she begs him to remember
that papa, notwithstanding his faults,
is still her father. At this he magnanimously
promises to spare the old man.</p>

<p>But the footstep is heard no more; papa
does not appear. G. W. S. puts on his overcoat.
Then the couple stand by the door
and settle the Tom Johnson matter. She
says she never cared for Tom Johnson, and
he says he knows it and that he (G. W. S.,
you understand) is a brute, and that she is an
angel, and that he will never again refer to the
aforesaid Tom Johnson. He will, though, the
very next time they meet, just as he has every
time they have met for the last two months.</p>

<p>While they are talking the clock strikes
the half hour, but they don’t hear it. The
Johnson business disposed of, they discuss
their future prospects, vow eternal fidelity,
compare themselves to all the famous lovers
of history (to none of whom they bear the
slightest resemblance), make an appointment
for Wednesday evening (on which occasion
G. W. S. will have the extreme felicity
of spending two-thirds of his week’s
salary for theatre tickets and a supper at the
Brunswick), and indulge in the usual osculation.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clock begins to strike twelve,
and at the same moment a hoarse masculine
cough is heard in the room overhead. The
fatal moment has really and truly arrived this
time. One more kiss, one more embrace,
and they part—he to go home and oversleep
in the morning, and be docked fifty cents at
the store; she to receive the reproaches of
an irate parent, who hasn’t been young for
such a long time himself that he has forgotten
all about it.</p>

<p>It is a common saying that the public
speaker who can draw both smiles and tears
from his audience is the highest type of orator.
The same is true of the reciter. If you
would awaken pathetic emotions in the hearts
of your hearers, you must have recitations
suited to this purpose, tender in sentiment
and full of feeling. A charming collection
of such pieces is here furnished.</p>

<p>Put yourself fully into the spirit of each
selection. Do not deliver a pathetic recitation
in a cold, unfeeling manner. Look well
to the tones of your voice and facial expression.
If you feel the words you are uttering,
the subtle influence cannot fail to move those
who hear you. You cannot put on an appearance
of feeling; give reality to all the
emotions your words express.</p>

<h4>IN MEMORIAM.</h4>

<p>It was a strange coincidence, and a fitting end for a noble old seaman
who had given his life to the service of his country, that Rear-Admiral
W. A. Kirkland, U. S. N., and once commandant at Mare Island, should
die the day peace was declared between our country and Spain. In strong
tones give the command, “Cease firing!” Point to “the red flames,” “the
gray smoke-shrouded hills,” “the weary troops,” “the armored squadron,”
etc. On the first two lines of the last verse use <a href="#gesture11">Figure 11 of Typical

<h4>“COALS OF FIRE.”</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The coffin was a plain one—no flowers
on its top, no lining of rose-white
satin for the pale brow, no smooth
ribbons about the coarse shroud. The brown
hair was laid decently back, but there was no
crimped cap, with its neat tie beneath the
chin. “I want to see my mother,” sobbed a
poor child, as the city undertaker screwed
down the top. “You can’t: get out of the
way, boy! Why don’t somebody take the
brat away?” “Only let me see her for one
minute,” cried the hapless orphan, clutching
the side of the charity box. And as he
gazed into that rough face tears streamed
down the cheek on which no childish bloom
every lingered. Oh, it was pitiful to hear
him cry, “Only once! let me see my mother
only once!”</p>

<p>Brutally, the hard-hearted monster struck
the boy away, so that he reeled with the
blow. For a moment the boy stood panting
with grief and rage, his blue eyes expanded,
his lips sprang apart; a fire glittered through
his tears as he raised his puny arm, and with
a most unchildish accent screamed, “When
I am a man I’ll kill you for that!” A coffin
and a heap of earth was between the mother
and the poor forsaken child; a monument
stronger than granite built in his boy-heart
to the memory of a heartless deed.</p>

<p>The court house was crowded to suffocation.
“Does any one appear as this man’s
counsel?” asked the judge. There was
silence when he finished, until, with lips
tightly pressed together, a look of strange
recognition blended with haughty reserve
upon his handsome features, a young man, a
stranger, stepped forward to plead for the
erring and the friendless. The splendor of
his genius entranced, convinced. The man
who could not find a friend was acquitted.</p>

<p>“May God bless you, sir! I cannot.” “I
want no thanks,” replied the stranger, with
icy coldness. “I—I believe you are unknown
to me.” “Man, I will refresh your memory.
Twenty years ago you struck a broken-hearted
boy away from his poor mother’s
coffin; I was that poor, miserable boy.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
“Have you rescued me, then, to take my
life?” “No! I have a sweeter revenge: I
have saved the life of a man whose brutal
deed has rankled in my breast for twenty
years. Go, and remember the tears of a
friendless child.”</p>

<h4>DIRGE OF THE DRUMS.</h4>

<p>The effect produced by this selection will depend very much upon the
manner in which you speak the constantly repeated word, “Dead!” It should
be spoken with subdued force, rather slowly, and in a low tone. Show
intense emotion, but not in a boisterous manner.</p>

<h4>THE OLD DOG’S DEATH POSTPONED.</h4>

<p>Any one at all familiar with farm life knows that when the old dog
becomes blind, toothless and helpless it is the sad but humane duty
of the farmer to put an end to his sufferings; it is generally done
by taking him off to the woods and shooting him. Although the new dog
quickly wins his place in our affections, the old is not soon forgotten,
and more than one story begins: “You remember how old Fide.” Give strong
expression in the last verse to the old man’s sudden change of purpose.</p>

coming forward to a queer-looking

<p>All the afternoon she sat there so quiet

but when I looked more closely I could see
every once in a while a great tear rolling
down her cheek, which she would wipe away
hastily with her cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>The depot was crowded and all was bustle
and hurry until the 9.50 train going east
came due; then every passenger left except
the old lady. It is very rare indeed that
any one takes the night express, and almost
always, after I have struck ten, the depot
becomes silent and empty.</p>

<p>The ticket agent put on his great coat, and
bidding Simmons keep his wits about him
for once in his life, departed for home.</p>

<p>But he had no sooner gone than that functionary
stretched himself out upon the table,
as usual, and began to snore vociferously.
Then it was I witnessed such a sight as
I never had before and never expect to
again.</p>

<p>The fire had gone down—it was a cold
night, and the wind howled dismally outside.
The lamps grew dim and flared, casting
weird shadows upon the wall. By and by I
heard a smothered sob from the corner, then
another. I looked in that direction. She
had risen from her seat, and oh! the look of
agony on the poor, pinched face.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it,” she sobbed, wringing
her thin, white hands. “Oh! I can’t believe
it! My babies! my babies! how often
have I held them in my arms and kissed
them; and how often they used to say back
to me, ‘Ise love you, mamma;’ and now,
O God! they’ve turned against me. Where
am I going? To the poor-house! No! no!
no! I cannot! I will not! Oh, the disgrace!”</p>

<p>And sinking upon her knees, she sobbed
out in prayer: “O God! spare me this and
take me home! O God, spare me this disgrace;
spare me!”</p>

<p>The wind rose higher, and swept through
the crevices icy cold. How it moaned and
seemed to sob like something human that is
hurt. I began to shake, but the kneeling
figure never stirred. The thin shawl had
dropped from her shoulders unheeded. Simmons
turned over and drew his heavy blanket
more closely around him.</p>

<p>Oh, how cold! Only one lamp remained,
burning dimly; the other two had gone out for
want of oil. I could hardly see, it was so dark.</p>

<p>At last she became quieter, and ceased to
moan. Then I grew drowsy, and kind of
lost the run of things after I had struck
twelve, when some one entered the depot
with a bright light. I started up. It was
the brightest light I ever saw, and seemed to
fill the room full of glory. I could see ’twas
a man. He walked to the kneeling figure
and touched her upon the shoulder. She
started up and turned her face wildly around.
I heard him say:</p>

<p>“’Tis train time, ma’am. Come!”</p>

<p>A look of joy came over her face.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Then give me your pass, ma’am.”</p>

<p>She reached him a worn old book, which
he took and from it read aloud:</p>

<p>“Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”</p>

<p>“That’s the pass over our road, ma’am.
Are you ready?”</p>

<p>The light died away and darkness fell in
its place. My hand touched the stroke of
one. Simmons awoke with a start, and
snatched his lantern. The whistles sounded
down brakes; the train was due. He ran to
the corner and shook the old woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>“Wake up, marm; ’tis train time.”</p>

<p>But she never heeded. He gave one look
at the white, set face, and dropping his lantern,
fled.</p>

<p>The up-train halted, the conductor shouted
“All aboard,” but no one made a move that
way.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the ticket agent
came, he found her frozen to death. They
whispered among themselves, and the coroner
made out the verdict “apoplexy,” and it
was in some way hushed up.</p>

<p>They laid her out in the depot, and advertised
for her friends, but no one came. So,
after the second day they buried her.</p>

<p>The last look on the sweet old face, lit up
with a smile so unearthly, I keep with me
yet; and when I think of the occurrence of that
night, I know that she went out on the other
train, that never stopped at the poor-house.</p>

<h4>SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO.</h4>

<p>It were well worth while to insert this wonderfully beautiful and
pathetic selection here to preserve it in enduring type, but it has the
additional merit of being a most excellent piece for recitation. The

<h4>STONEWALL JACKSON’S DEATH.</h4>

<p>Gen. Joseph Hooker, in command of the Army of the Potomac lying opposite
Fredericksburg, Md., crossed the Rappahannock River early in May, 1863,
and fought the severe battle of Chancellorsville, in which was killed the
famous Southern general, Thomas J. Jackson, commonly known as Stonewall
Jackson. He received this name at the first battle of Bull Run. Defeat
seemed imminent, and one of the Confederate generals exclaimed: “Here
stands Jackson like a stone wall, and here let us conquer or die!” Gen.
Jackson’s last words were: “Let us cross over the river, and lie down
under the trees.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nor did we turn aside to sing, or turn aside to weep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as we pondered o’er our griefs, a sudden moan was heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far louder than the willow’s moan, when by the wind ’tis stirred.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It woke the camp from reverie, it woke the camp to fear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And louder, louder grew the wail, most dreadful then to hear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And nearer came the weeping crowd, and something stiff and still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was borne, we knew not what it was, but followed with a will.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At last within our Gen’ral’s tent the precious load was laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then a pallid soldier turned unto us all, and said:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘We thought it hard, my comrades brave, to lose the field to-day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But harder will our struggle be, to labor in the fray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he is gone, our gallant chief, who could our hopes restore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rout and ruin is our fate, since Stonewall is no more.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I cannot tell you how we felt, or how we acted then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For words are weak to tell a tale when grief has mastered men;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But this I know, I pulled the cloth from off brave Jackson’s face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And almost jumped with joy to see him gaze around the place.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, boys, it was a fleeting dream, a vacant stare he cast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He did not see the canvas shaken by the sudden blast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He did not see us weeping as we staunched the flowing blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But again in battle fighting, he was where the foemen stood.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Order Gen’ral Hill to action!’ loud he cried, as he was wont;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then he quickly added: ‘Bring the infantry to front!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he saw the corps pass by him—as it were—in duty’s call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suddenly he shouted: ‘Drive them! charge upon them, one and all!’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then he turned aside, and, smiling, said with voice of one in ease:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Let us cross the foaming river; let us rest beneath the trees.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then we waited, boys, and watched him, but no other word he said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For adown the foaming river had our leader’s spirit sped.”</div>

    <div class="dropcapline">You’re a kind woman, Nan! Ay, kind and true!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God will be good to faithful folk like you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You knew my Ned?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A better, kinder lad never drew breath.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We loved each other true, and we were wed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In church, like some who took him to his death;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lad as gentle as a lamb, but lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His senses when he took a drop too much.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Drink did it all—drink made him mad when crossed—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He was a poor man, and they’re hard on such</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Nan! that night! that night!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When I was sitting in this very chair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Watching and waiting in the candle-light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And heard his foot come creaking up the stair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turned and saw him standing yonder, white</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wild, with staring eyes and rumpled hair!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when I caught his arm and called in fright,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">He pushed me, swore, and to the door he passed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To lock and bar it fast.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then down he drops just like a lump of lead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Holding his brow, shaking, and growing whiter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And—Nan—just then the light seemed growing brighter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I could see the hands that held his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All red! all bloody red!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What could I do but scream? He groaned to hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Jumped to his feet, and gripped me by the wrist;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Be still, or I shall kill thee, Nell!” he hissed.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And I was still for fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“They’re after me—I’ve knifed a man!” he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be still!—the drink—drink did it!—he is dead!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then we grew still, dead still. I couldn’t weep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All I could do was cling to Ned and hark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Ned was cold, cold, cold, as if asleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But breathing hard and deep.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The candle flickered out—the room grew dark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And—Nan!—although my heart was true and tried—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all grew cold and dim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shuddered—not for fear of them outside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But just afraid to be alone with him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ned! Ned!” I whispered—and he moaned and shook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But did not heed or look!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ned! Ned! speak, lad! tell me it is not true!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At that he raised his head and looked so wild;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, with a stare that froze my blood, he threw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His arms around me, crying like a child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And held me close—and not a word was spoken,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While I clung tighter to his heart and pressed him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And did not fear him, though my heart was broken,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But kissed his poor stained hands, and cried, and blessed him!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, Nan, the dreadful daylight, coming cold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With sound of falling rain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I could see his face, and it looked old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the pinched face of one that dies in pain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, though we heard folk stirring in the sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We never thought to hide away or run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until we heard those voices in the street,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hurrying of feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Ned leaped up, and knew that they had come.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Run, Ned!” I cried, but he was deaf and dumb;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hide, Ned!” I screamed, and held him; “Hide thee, man!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He stared with blood-shot eyes and hearkened, Nan!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the rest is like a dream—the sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of knocking at the door—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A rush of men—a struggle on the ground—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mist—a tramp—a roar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For when I got my senses back again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The room was empty, and my head went round!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God help him? God <i>will</i> help him! Ay, no fear!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was the drink, not Ned—he meant no wrong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So kind! So good!—and I am useless here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now he is lost that loved me true and long.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That night before he died,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I didn’t cry—my heart was hard and dried;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when the clocks went “one,” I took my shawl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cover up my face, and stole away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And walked along the silent streets, where all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looked cold and still and gray.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some men and lads went by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turning round, I gazed, and watched ’em go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then felt that they were going to see him die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And drew my shawl more tight, and followed slow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More people passed me, a country cart with hay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stopped close beside me, and two or three</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Talked about <i>it</i>! I moaned, and crept away!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Next came a hollow sound I knew full well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For something gripped me round the heart—and then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There came the solemn tolling of a bell!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O God! O God! how could I sit close by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And neither scream nor cry?</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if I had been stone, all hard and cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I listened, listened, listened, still and dumb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the folk murmured, and the death-bell tolled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the day brightened, and his time had come.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All else was silent but the knell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the slow bell!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I could only wait, and wait, and wait,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what I waited for I couldn’t tell—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At last there came a groaning deep and great—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">St. Paul’s struck “eight”—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I screamed, and seemed to turn to fire and fell!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">God bless him, alive or dead!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He never meant no wrong, was kind and true.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’re wrought their fill of spite upon his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why didn’t they be kind, and take me too?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there’s the dear old things he used to wear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there’s a lock of hair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Ned, my Ned! is fast asleep, and cannot hear me call.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God bless you, Nan, for all you’ve done and said!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But don’t mind me, my heart is broke, that’s all!</div>

<h4>THE DRUNKARD’S DAUGHTER.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">She was a bright and beautiful child,
one who seemed born for a better
career, yet one on whom the
blight of intemperance had left its impress
early.</p>

<p>Her father was a drunkard, a worthless,
miserable sot, whose only aim and ambition
in life seemed to be to contrive ways and
means of satisfying the devouring fire that
constantly burned within him.</p>

<p>Her mother had died when she was a mere
child, leaving her to grow up a wild flower
in the forest, uncultured and uncared for.</p>

<p>Yet she was very beautiful; her form and
face were of wondrous perfection and loveliness;
her disposition was happy and cheerful,
notwithstanding the abuse to which she was
continually subjected.</p>

<p>The years went by; she grew to be almost
a woman. She could not go to school or
church, because she had nothing respectable
to wear; and had she gone her wicked father
would have reviled her for her disposition to
make something better of herself and for her
simple piety. He sank lower and lower in
the miserable slough of intemperance, and
yet, when urged by well-meaning friends, to
leave him she clung to him with an affection as
unaccountable as it was earnest and sincere.</p>

<p>“If I should leave him he would die,” she
said. “If I stay and suffer with him here,
some time I may save him and make him a
worthy man.”</p>

<p>Many would have given her a home, food
and comfortable clothes, but she preferred to
share her father’s misery rather than selfishly
forsake him in his unhappy infirmity.</p>

<p>The summer passed, the berries ripened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
and disappeared from the bushes. The leaves
turned to crimson and yellow, and fell from
the trees. The cold November winds howled
through the desolate hollows, while, scantily
clad, she crouched in a corner of her inhospitable,
unhappy home.</p>

<p>She was very ill; bad treatment, poor food,
and exposure had brought on a fatal sickness.
Her brow burned with fever. Even her
wretched father, selfish and inebriated as he
was, became alarmed at her condition as he
staggered about the room upon his return at
a late hour from the village tavern, where he
had spent the evening with a company of
dissolute companions.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “I am very sick; the
doctor has been to see me; he left a prescription.
Will you not go to the village and get
it filled?”</p>

<p>“They won’t trust me, child,” he said,
gruffly.</p>

<p>“But I will trust you,” she said sweetly.
“There is a little money hidden in the old clock
there, which I saved from picking and selling
berries. You can take it; there is enough.”</p>

<p>His eyes sparkled with a dangerous glitter.</p>

<p>“Money!” he exclaimed almost fiercely.
“I didn’t know you had money. Why didn’t
you tell me before? Didn’t you know it
belonged by right to me?”</p>

<p>She sighed pitifully.</p>

<p>He staggered to the clock, fumbled about
for a few moments, and soon found what he
was seeking.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go,” he said, excitedly. “Give
me the prescription.”</p>

<p>He snatched it from her extended hand,
opened the door and disappeared.</p>

<p>The night grew colder. The sick girl crept
into bed and tossed and turned restlessly.
The oil in the old lamp burned out. The
windows rattled, a storm came, and rain and
hail beat upon the window panes. The old
clock struck the hour of midnight. The
drunkard did not return.</p>

<p>Poor girl, her soul became filled with apprehension
and fear for him.</p>

<p>“I must go for him,” she said. “He will
perish, and it will be my fault.” She crawled
out of bed, drew on her scanty apparel and
worn shoes, threw a ragged shawl over her
head and shoulders, and went forth into the
darkness, heroically facing the driving storm.</p>

<p>The morning came, clear, cloudless and
beautiful. The earth was cold and frosty.
A neighbor, going early to the village, found
two lifeless forms lying by the roadway.
Beside the dead man lay an empty black
bottle. The girl’s white arms were clasped
about his neck. Her soul had gone to intercede
for him before the Mercy Seat on high.</p>

    <div class="dropcapline">’Twas a stylish congregation, that of Theophrastus Brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And its organ was the finest and the biggest in the town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the chorus, all the papers favorably commented on it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ’twas said each female member had a forty—dollar bonnet.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now in the “amen corner” of the church sat Brother Eyer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who persisted every Sabbath-day in singing with the choir;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was poor, but genteel-looking, and his heart as snow was white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his old face beamed with sweetness when he sang with all his might.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His voice was cracked and broken, age had touched his vocal chords,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And nearly every Sunday he would mispronounce the words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the hymns, and ’twas no wonder, he was old and nearly blind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the choir rattling onward always left him far behind.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the pastor called together in the lecture-room one day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seven influential members who subscribe more than they pay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And having asked God’s guidance in a printed prayer or two,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They put their heads together to determine what to do.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They debated, thought, suggested, till at last “dear Brother York,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who last winter made a million on a sudden rise in pork,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose and moved that a committee wait at once on Brother Eyer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And proceed to rake him lively for “disturbin’ of the choir.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of course the motion carried, and one day a coach and four,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the latest style of driver, rattled up to Eyer’s door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sleek, well-dressed committee, Brothers Sharkey, York, and Lamb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As they crossed the humble portal took good care to miss the jam.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They found the choir’s great trouble sitting in his old arm-chair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the summer’s golden sunbeams lay upon his thin white hair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was singing “Rock of Ages” in a voice both cracked and low,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Said York: “We’re here, dear brother, with the vestry’s approbation,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It was the understanding when we bargained for the chorus</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That you’ll have to stop your singin’, for it flurrytates the choir.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The old man slowly raised his head, a sign that he did hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on his cheek the trio caught the glitter of a tear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His feeble hands pushed back the locks white as the silky snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he answered the committee in a voice both sweet and low;</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve sung the psalms of David for nearly eighty years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’ve been my staff and comfort and calmed life’s many fears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m sorry I disturb the choir, perhaps I’m doing wrong;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when my heart is filled with praise, I can’t keep back a song.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wonder if beyond the tide that’s breaking at my feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the far-off heavenly temple, where the Master I shall greet,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, I wonder when I try to sing the songs of God up higher.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If the angel band will church me for disturbing heaven’s choir.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A silence filled the little room; the old man bowed his head;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The carriage rattled on again, but Brother Eyer was dead!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, dead! his hand had raised the veil the future hangs before us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Master dear had called him to the everlasting chorus.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The choir missed him for awhile, but he was soon forgot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A few church-goers watched the door; the old man entered not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far away, his voice no longer cracked, he sings his heart’s desires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where there are no church committees and no fashionable choirs.</div>

<h4>EXECUTION OF MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Queen arrived in the hall of death.
Pale but unflinching she contemplated
the dismal preparations. There lay
the block and the axe. There stood the executioner
and his assistant. All were clothed
in mourning. On the floor was scattered the
sawdust which was to soak her blood, and in a
dark corner lay the bier. It was nine o’clock
when the Queen appeared in the funereal hall.
Fletcher, Dean of Peterborough, and certain
privileged persons, to the number of more
than two hundred, were assembled. The
hall was hung with black cloth; the scaffold,
which was elevated about two feet and a half
above the ground, was covered with black
frieze of Lancaster; the arm-chair in which
Mary was to sit, the footstool on which she
was to kneel, the block on which her head
was to be laid, were covered with black velvet.</p>

<p>The Queen was clothed in mourning like
the hall and as the ensign of punishment.
Her black velvet robe, with its high collar
and hanging sleeves, was bordered with ermine.
Her mantle, lined with marten sable,
was of satin, with pearl buttons and a long
train. A chain of sweet-smelling beads, to
which was attached a scapulary, and beneath
that a golden cross, fell upon her bosom.
Two rosaries were suspended to her girdle,
and a long veil of white lace, which in some
measure softened this costume of a widow
and of a condemned criminal, was thrown
around her.</p>

<p>Arrived on the scaffold, Mary seated herself
in the chair provided for her, with her
face toward the spectators. The Dean of
Peterborough, in ecclesiastical costume, sat
on the right of the Queen, with a black velvet
footstool before him. The Earls of Kent
and Shrewsbury were seated, like him, on the
right, but upon larger chairs. On the other
side of the Queen stood the Sheriff, Andrews,
with white wand. In front of Mary were
seen the executioner and his assistant, distinguishable
by their vestments of black velvet
with red crape round the left arm. Behind
the Queen’s chair, ranged by the wall, wept
her attendants and maidens.</p>

<p>In the body of the hall, the nobles and
citizens from the neighboring counties were
guarded by musketeers. Beyond the balustrade
was the bar of the tribunal. The sentence
was read; the Queen protested against
it in the name of royalty and of innocence,
but accepted death for the sake of the faith.
She then knelt before the block and the
executioner proceeded to remove her veil.
She repelled him by a gesture, and turning
toward the Earls with a blush on her forehead,
“I am not accustomed,” she said, “to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
be undressed before so numerous a company,
and by the hands of such grooms of the
chamber.”</p>

<p>She then called Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth
Curle, who took off her mantle, her veil,
her chains, cross and scapulary. On their
touching her robe, the Queen told them to
unloosen the corsage and fold down the
ermine collar, so as to leave her neck bare
for the axe. Her maidens weepingly yielded
her these last services. Melvil and the three
other attendants wept and lamented, and
Mary placed her finger on her lips to signify
that they should be silent. She then arranged
the handkerchief embroidered with thistles of
gold with which her eyes had been covered
by Jane Kennedy.</p>

<p>Thrice she kissed the crucifix, each time
repeating, “Lord, into Thy hands I commend
my spirit.” She knelt anew and leant her
head on that block which was already scored
with deep marks, and in this solemn attitude
she again recited some verses from the Psalms.
The executioner interrupted her at the third
verse by a blow of the axe, but its trembling
stroke only grazed her neck; she groaned
slightly, and the second blow separated the
head from the body.</p>

<h4>LITTLE SALLIE’S WISH.</h4>

<p>The following poem was written from <i>facts</i>, concerning a sweet
little girl who lived in New York. When Summer came her parents took a
cottage in the country, where the scene described was enacted.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="dropcap"><img class="dropcap-narrow" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" /></div>
    <div class="dropcapline">I have seen the first robin of Spring, mother dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And have heard the brown darling sing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You said, “Hear it and wish, and ’twill surely come true,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So I’ve wished such a beautiful thing.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought I would like to ask something for you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But couldn’t think what there could be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you’d want, while you had all these beautiful things;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Besides you have papa and me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So I wished for a ladder, so long that ’twould stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">One end by our own cottage door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the other go up past the moon and the stars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And lean against heaven’s white floor.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I’d get you to put on my pretty white dress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With my sash and my darling new shoes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’d find some white roses to take up to God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The most beautiful ones I could choose.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And you, dear papa, would sit on the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And kiss me, and tell me “good-bye;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I’d go up the ladder, far out of your sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till I came to the door in the sky.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I wonder if God keeps the door fastened tight?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If but one little crack I could see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would whisper, “Please, God, let this little girl in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She’s as weary and tired as can be.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She came all alone from the earth to the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For she’s always been wanting to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gardens of heaven, with their robins and flowers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Please, God, is there room there for me?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And then when the angels had opened the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God would say, “Bring the little child here.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But He’d speak it so softly, I’d not be afraid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He’d smile just like you, mother dear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He would put His kind arms round your dear little girl,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I’d ask Him to send down for you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And papa, and cousin, and all that I love—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, dear, don’t you wish ’twould come true?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The next Spring time, when the robins came home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They sang over grasses and flowers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That grew where the foot of the long ladder stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose top reached the heavenly bowers.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the parents had dressed the pale, still child</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For her flight to the Summer land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a fair white robe, with one snow-white rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Folded tight in her pulseless hand.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now at the foot of the ladder they sit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Looking upward with quiet tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the beckoning hand and the fluttering robe</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the child at the top re-appears.</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A chamber with a low, dark ceiling,
supported by massive rafters of oak;
floors and walls of dark stone, unrelieved
by wainscot or plaster—bare,
rugged, and destitute.</p>

<p>A dim, smoking light, burning in a vessel
of iron, threw its red and murky beams over
the fearful contents of a table. It was piled
high with the unsightly forms of the dead.
Prostrate among these mangled bodies, his
arms flung carelessly on either side, slept and
dreamed Aldarin—Aldarin, the Fratricide.</p>

<p>He hung on the verge of a rock, a rock of
melting bitumen, that burned his hands to
masses of crisped and blackened flesh. The
rock projected over a gulf, to which the cataracts
of earth might compare as the rivulet
to the vast ocean. It was the Cataract of
Hell. He looked below. God of Heaven,
what a sight! Fiery waves, convulsed and
foaming, with innumerable whirlpools crimsoned
by bubbles of flame. Each whirlpool
swallowing millions of the lost. Each bubble
bearing on its surface the face of a soul, lost
and lost forever.</p>

<p>Born on by the waves, they raised their
hands and cast their burning eyes to the
skies, and shrieked the eternal death-wail of
the lost.</p>

<p>Over this scene, awful and vast, towered a
figure of ebony blackness, his darkened brow
concealed in the clouds, his extended arms
grasping the infinitude of the cataract, his feet
resting upon islands of bitumen far in the
gulf below. The eyes of the figure were
fixed upon Aldarin, as he clung with the nervous
clasp of despair to the rock, and their
gaze curdled his heated blood.</p>

<p>He was losing his grasp; sliding and sliding
from the rock, his feet hung over the
gulf. There was no hope for him. He must
fall—fall—and fall forever. But lo! a stairway,
built of white marble, wide, roomy and
secure, seemed to spring from the very rock
to which he clung, winding upward from the
abyss, till it was lost in the distance far, far
above. He beheld two figures slowly descending—the
figure of a warrior and the
form of a dark-eyed woman.</p>

<p>He knew those figures; he knew them
well. They were his victims! Her face, his
wife’s! beautiful as when he first wooed her in
the gardens of Palestine; but there was
blood on her vestments, near the heart, and
his lip was spotted with one drop of that
thick, red blood. “This,” he muttered, “this,
indeed, is hell, and yet I must call for aid—call
to them!” How the thought writhed
like a serpent round his very heart.</p>

<p>He drew himself along the rugged rock,
clutching the red-hot ore in the action. He
wanted but a single inch, a little inch and he
might grasp the marble of the stairway.
Another and a desperate effort. His fingers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
clutched it, but his strength was gone. He
could not hold it in his grasp. With an eye
of horrible intensity he looked above. “Thou
wilt save me, Ilmerine, my wife. Thou wilt
drag me up to thee.” She stooped. She
clutched his blackened fingers and placed
them around the marble. His grasp was
tight and desperate. “Julian, O Julian!
grasp this hand. Aid me, O Julian! my
brother!” The warrior stooped, laid hold on
his hand and drawing it toward the casement,
wound it around another piece of marble.</p>

<p>But again his strength fails. “Julian, my
brother; Ilmerine, my wife, seize me! Drag
me from this rock of terror! Save me! O
save me!” She stooped. She unwound
finger after finger. She looked at his horror-stricken
face and pointed to the red wound in
her heart. He looked toward the other face.
“Thou, Julian, reach me thy hand. Thy
hand, or I perish!” The warrior slowly
reached forth his hand from beneath the
folds of his cloak. He held before the eyes
of the doomed a goblet of gold. It shone
and glimmered through the foul air like the
beacon fire of hell.</p>

<p>“Take it away! ’Tis the death bowl!”
shrieked Aldarin’s livid lips. “I murdered
thee. Thou canst not save.” He drew back
from the maddening sight. He lost his hold,
he slid from the rock, he fell.</p>

<p>Above, beneath, around, all was fire, horror,
death; and still he fell. “Forever and forever,”
rose the shrieks of the lost. All hell
groaned aloud, “Ever, ever. Forever and
forever,” and his own soul muttered back,
“This—this—is—hell!”</p>

<h4>TOMMY’S PRAYER.</h4>

<p>This beautiful poem is full of the pathos and suffering of poverty. It
should be delivered with expression and feeling. Although lengthy the
interest is sustained throughout.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="dropcap"><img class="dropcap-narrow" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" /></div>
    <div class="dropcapline">In a dark and dismal alley where the sunshine never came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dwelt a little lad named Tommy, sickly, delicate and lame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had never yet been healthy, but had lain since he was born,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dragging out his weak existence well nigh hopeless and forlorn.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was six, was little Tommy, ’twas just five years ago</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since his drunken mother dropped him, and the babe was crippled so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had never known the comfort of a mother’s tender care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But her cruel blows and curses made his pain still worse to bear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There he lay within the cellar from the morning till the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starved, neglected, cursed, ill-treated, naught to make his dull life bright;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not a single friend to love him, not a living thing to love—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he knew not of a Saviour, or a heaven up above.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas a quiet summer evening; and the alley, too, was still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tommy’s little heart was sinking, and he felt so lonely, till,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Floating up the quiet alley, wafted inwards from the street,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came the sound of some one singing, sounding, oh! so clear and sweet.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Eagerly did Tommy listen as the singing nearer came—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! that he could see the singer! How he wished he wasn’t lame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then he called and shouted loudly, till the singer heard the sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on noting whence it issued, soon the little cripple found.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas a maiden, rough and rugged, hair unkempt and naked feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All her garments torn and ragged, her appearance far from neat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“So yer called me,” said the maiden, “wonder wot yer wants o’ me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most folks call me Singing Jessie; wot may your name chance to be?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My name’s Tommy; I’m a cripple, and I want to hear you sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it makes me feel so happy—sing me something, anything.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jessie laughed, and answered, smiling, “I can’t stay here very long,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I’ll sing a hymn to please you, wot I calls the ‘Glory song’”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then she sang to him of Heaven, pearly gates and streets of gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the happy angel children are not starved or nipped with cold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But where happiness and gladness never can decrease or end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And where kind and loving Jesus is their Sovereign and their Friend.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! how Tommy’s eyes did glisten as he drank in every word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it fell from “Singing Jessie”—was it true, what he had heard?</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so anxiously he asked her: “Is there really such a place?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a tear began to trickle down his pallid little face.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tommy, you’re a little heathen; why, it’s up beyond the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if yer will love the Saviour, yer shall go there when yer die.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then,” said Tommy; “tell me, Jessie, how can I the Saviour love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I’m down in this ’ere cellar, and he’s up in Heaven above?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So the little ragged maiden who had heard at Sunday-school</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All about the way to Heaven, and the Christian’s golden rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Taught the little cripple Tommy how to love and how to pray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then she sang a “Song of Jesus,” kissed his cheek and went away.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tommy lay within the cellar which had grown so dark and cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thinking all about the children in the streets of shining gold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he heeded not the darkness of that damp and chilly room,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the joy in Tommy’s bosom could disperse the deepest gloom.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! if I could only see it,” thought the cripple, as he lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Jessie said that Jesus listens and I think I’ll try and pray;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So he put his hands together, and he closed his little eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in accents weak, yet earnest, sent this message to the skies:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gentle Jesus, please forgive me, as I didn’t know afore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That yer cared for little cripples who is weak and very poor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I never heard of Heaven till that Jessie came to-day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And told me all about it, so I wants to try and pray.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You can see me, can’t yer, Jesus? Jessie told me that yer could,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I somehow must believe it, for it seems so prime and good;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she told me if I loved you, I should see yer when I die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the bright and happy heaven that is up beyond the sky.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lord, I’m only just a cripple, and I’m no use here below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I heard my mother whisper she’d be glad if I could go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’m cold and hungry sometimes; and I feel so lonely, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can’t yer take me, gentle Jesus, up to Heaven along o’ you?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! I’d be so good and patient, and I’d never cry or fret;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yer kindness to me, Jesus, I would surely not forget;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would love you all I know of, and would never make a noise—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can’t you find me just a corner, where I’ll watch the other boys?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! I think yer’ll do it, Jesus, something seems to tell me so,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I feel so glad and happy, and I do so want to go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How I long to see yer, Jesus, and the children all so bright!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come and fetch me, won’t yer, Jesus? Come and fetch me home to-night!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tommy ceased his supplication, he had told his soul’s desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he waited for the answer till his head began to tire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then he turned towards his corner, and lay huddled in a heap,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Closed his little eyes so gently, and was quickly fast asleep.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, I wish that every scoffer could have seen his little face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he lay there in the corner, in that damp and noisome place;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his countenance was shining like an angel’s, fair and bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it seemed to fill the cellar with a holy, heavenly light.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He had only heard of Jesus from a ragged singing girl,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He might well have wondered, pondered, till his brain began to whirl;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he took it as she told it, and believed it then and there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Simply trusting in the Saviour, and His kind and tender care.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the morning, when the mother came to wake her crippled boy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She discovered that his features wore a look of sweetest joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she shook him somewhat roughly, but the cripple’s face was cold—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had gone to join the children in the streets of shining gold.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tommy’s prayer had soon been answered, and the Angel Death had come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To remove him from his cellar, to His bright and heavenly home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where sweet comfort, joy and gladness never can decrease or end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And where Jesus reigns eternally, his Sovereign and his Friend.</div>

<p class="dropcap">Girl is very nice! Everybody who
has not the misfortune to be girl
will allow this. Nice girl will allow
it also as far as itself is concerned. Strange girl
is objectionable in the eyes of girl generally.</p>

seldom finds this out until it is suggested to
it by one of experience.</p>

<p>Healthy girl costs its parents less money
for doctors’ bills, but persons who write
romantic tales for circulating libraries choose
unhealthy and pasty faced girl to write about—the
swooning kind preferred.</p>

<p>If I were not boy I think I should like to
be girl. It’s best fun to be boy when there’s
plenty of girl about.</p>

<h4>THE STORY KATIE TOLD.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" width="140" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now, stay right still and listen, kitty-cat,
and I’ll tell you a story.</p>

<p>Once there was a girl.</p>

<p>She was a pretty good little girl,
and minded her papa ’n’ mamma everything
they said, only sometimes she didn’t, and then
she was naughty; but she was always sorry,
and said she wouldn’t do so any more, and
her mamma’d forgive her.</p>

<p>She was going to hang up her stocking.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to be pretty good, ’lest
’twon’t be filled,” said her mamma.</p>

<p>“’Less maybe there’ll be a big bunch of
sticks in it,” said her papa.</p>

<p>Do you think that’s a nice way to talk,
kitty-cat? I don’t.</p>

<p>So the little girl was good as she could be,
’less she was bigger, and didn’t cry and slap
her little sister hardly any at all, and always
minded her mamma when she came where
the chimney was, ’specially much.</p>

<p>So she hung up her stocking.</p>

<p>And in the night she got awake, and
wanted it to come morning; but in the
morning she didn’t get awake till ’twas all
sunshiny out doors.</p>

<p>Then she ran quick as she could to look at
her stocking where she’d hung it; and true’s
you live, kitty-cat, there wasn’t the leastest
thing in it—not the leastest bit of a scrimp!</p>

<p>Oh, the little girl felt dreadfully! How’d
you feel, s’pose it had been you, kitty-cat?</p>

<p>She ’menced to cry, the little girl did, and
she kept going harder ’n harder, till by’mby
she screeched orfly, and her mamma came
running to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” said her mamma. “Look
over by the window ’fore you do that any
more, Kathie.”</p>

<p>That little girl’s name was Kathie too,
kitty-cat, just the same’s mine.</p>

<p>So she looked over by the window, the
way her mamma said, and—oh! there was
the loveliest dolly’s house you ever saw in
all your born life.</p>

<p>It had curtains to pull to the sides when
you wanted to play, and pull in front when
you didn’t.</p>

<p>There was a bed-room, kitty-cat, and a
dinner-room, and a kitchen, and a parlor, and
they all had carpets on.</p>

<p>And there was the sweetest dolly in the
parlor, all dressed up in blue silk! Oh,
dear! And a penano, to play real little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
tunes on, and a rocking-chair, and—O kitty-cat!
I can’t begin to tell you half about it.</p>

<p>I can’t about the bed-room, either, and the
dinner-room.</p>

<p>But the kitchen was the very bestest of
all. There was a stove—a teeny tonty mite
of a one, kitty-cat,—with dishes just zactly
like mamma’s, only littler, of course, and
fry-pans and everything; and spoons to
stir with, and a rolling-pin, and two little cutters-out,
and the darlingest baker-sheet ever
you saw!</p>

<p>And the first thing that little girl did was
to make some teenty mites of cookies, ’cause
her mamma let her; and if you’ll come right
down stairs, kitty-cat, I’ll give you one.</p>

<p>’Cause I was that little girl, kitty-cat, all
the time.</p>

<h4>LABOR SONG.</h4>

<p>This is a charming exercise for boys and girls. Each should be dressed in
the costume of the character to be represented, and, as far as possible,
should go through the motions called for by the part. The properties can
all be placed on the stage before the performance begins. Each character
comes in alone, those who have already entered remaining until the close.
All unite in singing the chorus, after each performer has spoken or sung
(according to choice) the part he or she is to act. Music suitable for
this selection is herewith furnished. Come in promptly and avoid long
pauses.</p>

<h4>WHAT BABY SAID.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am here. And if this is what they call
the world, I don’t think much of it.
It’s a very flannelly world and smells
of paregoric awfully. It’s a dreadful light
world, too, and makes me blink, I tell you.
And I don’t know what to do with my hands;
I think I’ll dig my fists in my eyes. No, I
won’t. I’ll scratch at the corner of my
blanket and chew it up, and then I’ll holler;
whatever happens, I’ll holler. And the more
paregoric they give me, the louder I’ll yell.
That old nurse puts the spoon in the corner
of my mouth, sidewise like, and keeps tasting
my milk herself all the while. She spilt
snuff in it last night, and when I hollered she
trotted me. That comes of being a two-days-old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
baby. Never mind; when I’m a
man, I’ll pay her back good.</p>

<p>There’s a pin sticking in me now, and if I
say a word about it, I’ll be trotted or fed;
and I would rather have catnip-tea. I heard
folks say, “Hush! don’t wake up Emeline’s
baby;” and I suppose that pretty, white-faced
woman on the pillow is Emeline.</p>

<p>No, I was mistaken; for a chap was in
here just now and wanted to see Bob’s baby
and looked at me and said I was a funny
little toad, and looked just like Bob. He
smelt of cigars. I wonder who else I belong
to! Yes, there’s another one—that’s
“Gamma.” “It was Gamma’s baby, so it
was.” I declare, I don’t know who I belong
to; but I’ll holler, and maybe I’ll find out.
There comes snuffy with catnip tea. I’m
going to sleep. I wonder why my hands
won’t go where I want them to!</p>

<h4>THE LITTLE TORMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="140" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">My name’s Jack. I’m eight years
old. I’ve a sister Arathusa, and
she calls me a little torment.
I’ll tell you why: You know
Arathusa has got a beau, and he comes to see
her every night, and they turn the gas ’way,
’way down ’till you can’t hardly see. I like
to stay in the room with the gas on full
blaze, but Arathusa skites me out of the
room every night.</p>

<p>I checked her once, you better believe.
You know she went to the door to let Alphonso
in, and I crawled under the sofa.
Then they came in, and it got awful dark,
and they sat down on the sofa, and I couldn’t
hear nothing but smack! smack! smack!
Then I reached out and jerked Arathusa’s
foot. Then she jumped and said, “Oh,
mercy, what’s that?” and Alphonso said
she was a “timid little creature.” “Oh, Alphonso,
I’m happy by your side, but when I
think of your going away it almost breaks
my heart.”</p>

<p>Then I snickered right out, I couldn’t help
it, and Arathusa got up, went and peeked
through the keyhole and said, “I do believe
that’s Jack, nasty little torment, he’s always
where he isn’t wanted.” Do you know this
made me mad, and I crawled out from under
the sofa and stood up before her and said,
“You think you are smart because you have
got a beau. I guess I know what you’ve been
doing; you’ve been sitting on Alphonso’s lap,
and letting him kiss you like you let Bill Jones
kiss you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
If it hadn’t been for that old false front
of yours, Pa would have let me have a bicycle
like Tom Clifford’s. You needn’t be grinding
them false teeth of yours at me, I ain’t a-going
out of here. I ain’t so green as I look. I
guess I know a thing or two. I don’t care if

<h4>THE HEIR APPARENT.</h4>

<p>A small boy who can adopt the air and demeanor of the “afflicted parent”
will make this soliloquy very amusing.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A Baby! Yes—a baby—a real, definite,
unquestionable baby! <i>What of it?</i>
do you ask. Well, that’s queer.
Don’t know what a baby is? I’m
sorry for you. My advice is—go and get one.</p>

<p>Heigho! I’m weighted down with my responsibility.
Solferino in color—no hair on
its head—kicks—yowls—mews—whines-sneezes—squints—makes
up mouths—it’s a
singular circumstance—<i>that</i> baby is, and—but
never mind.</p>

<p>Cross? I guess that’s a beginning of the
truth, so far as <i>it’s</i> concerned, but, why did
it happen along just at the moment when
muslin, linen and white flannel were the
highest they had been since Adam built a
hen-house for Mrs. Eve’s chickens? when
the doctors charge two dollars a squint, four
dollars a grunt, and, on account of the
scarcity in the country, take what is left in
a man’s pocket, no discount for cash, and
send bill for balance, Jan. 1st? Queer, isn’t
it? (<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>A queer little thing is that baby; a speck
of a nose like a wart, head as bald as a
squash, and no place to hitch a waterfall; a
mouth just situated to come the gum-game
and chew milk. Oh! you should hear her
sing. I have stuffed my fur cap down its
throat, given it the smoothing-iron to play
with; but that little red lump that looks as
if it couldn’t hold blood enough to keep a
musketo from fainting, persists to swallow
its fists, and the other day they dropped
down its throat, to the crook in its elbows.
<i>That</i> stopped its music, and I was happy for
one and a half minutes.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant thing to have a baby in the
house—one of your achy kind. Think of
the pleasures of a father in his night costume,
trembling in the midnight hour, with
his warm feet upon a square yard of oilcloth,
dropping paregoric in a teaspoon, by moonlight,
the nurse thumping at the door, and
the wife of your bosom crying “hurray,” and
the baby yelling till the fresco drops from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
the ceiling. It’s a nice time to think of
dress coats, pants, ties, and white kids.</p>

<p>Its mother says the darling is troubled
with—oh, don’t mention it. I have got to
get up in the cold and shiver while the milk
warms—it uses the bottle. I tried to stop
its growth the other night; it was no go.
I rocked so hard that I missed stays, and
sent it slap clear across the room, upsetting
the flower-stand. It didn’t make any noise
then! Oh, no! I was a happy man. Oh,
yes. (<i>A pause.</i>) That baby’s mother says
only wait until it gets bleached (it’s been
vaccinated) and old enough to crawl about
and feed on pins. Yes, I’m going to wait.
Won’t it be delightful?</p>

<p>John, run for the doctor; it’s fallen into
the slop pail; it’s choking with a peach-skin;
or it has fallen down stairs; or has swallowed
the tack-hammer; or shows signs of the
mumps, croup, whooping cough, small pox,
cholera infantum, or some other curious
thing to let the doctor take the money laid
by for my winter’s donation to the poor.</p>

<p>Shampooing, curling my hair, wearing nice
clothes, going to parties? Oh, no more of
that! No—more—of—that. A baby—oh!
I’m an old fellow now. Adieu, vain world!</p>

<h4>THE BROOM DRILL.</h4>

<p>Marches and drills by the little folks are always very attractive
and entertaining. The preparation for these benefits young people by
requiring them to move the body quickly and gracefully, assuming an erect
attitude, then other positions at the word of command. Such exercises
also aid in forming a habit of strict attention.</p>

<p>The Broom Drill is one of the most entertaining, and can readily be
learned. It should be practiced until it can be performed promptly and
without any mistakes. Twelve or sixteen girls—in fact, any even number,
according to the size of the stage—may take part in it.</p>

<p>All should be dressed alike, in blouse waist of Turkey red chintz,
sleeves and collar trimmed with white braid; skirt made of white cheese
cloth, trimmed above the hem with band of red chintz, four or five inches
wide; a red cap completes the costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<p>During the marching there should be music, and the notes of the piano
should be struck sharply. Any good march will answer for the music. The
following exercises conform very nearly to the “Manual of Arms” used
in the army. The cuts will be found very serviceable in showing the
different positions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/drill-fig0.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Standing in rank near the front
side of the stage, the teacher gives
the command to “present arms,”
“carry arms,” “trail arms,” etc. Each command
consists of two words: the first is to
indicate what the pupil is to do, and on the
second word the movement is made, all acting
in concert.</p>

<p>The following exercises are suitable for
this drill, and always prove very entertaining
to the audience.</p>

<p><i>Carry</i>—<span class="smcap">Arms!</span>—The broom is held in the
right hand, handle upward, with the hand
clasping the handle where it joins the brush.
The left hand hangs at the side. (Fig. 1.)</p>

<h5>MOVEMENTS OF ATTACK AND
DEFENSE.</h5>

<p>These can be executed only with open
ranks, the pupils being placed seven or eight
feet apart. To so place them, the teacher
will give the order—</p>

<p><i>Right (or Left) open Ranks</i>—<span class="smcap">March!</span>—The
pupils face to the right or left, according to
the order given, except the one at the extreme
end of the line. The others march,
the last of the file halting at every four or
five steps from the one in the rear, until all
are the same distance apart. They then face
front. To close the rank, turn to the right
or left and march toward the pupil standing
at the end until halted by the one ahead.
Then face front.</p>

<p><i>Attention</i>—<span class="smcap">Guard!</span>—At the command
<i>guard</i>, half face to the right, carry back and
place the right foot about twice its length to
the rear and nearly the same distance to the
right, the feet at little less than a right angle,
the right toe pointing squarely to the right,
both knees bent slightly, weight of the body
held equally on both legs; at the same time
throw the end of the stick to the front, at
the height of the chin, grasping it lightly
with both hands, the right just above the
brush, the left a few inches higher; the right
hand in line with the left hip and both arms
held free from the body and without constraint.

<h5>THE MARCH.</h5>

<p>There should be music while the pupils are coming
upon the stage and leaving. Any spirited march
will answer.</p>

<p>Girls enter from right and left sides of
stage at the back, eight on each side, and
march in single files according to the diagram
furnished below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/march.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When they meet at C F, separate and
march to L F and R F, then up sides of stage
to back, then across back to C B. When they
meet at C B, form couples and march in
twos forward on centre line. At C F first
couple turn to R F, second to L F, third to
R F, fourth to L F, etc. March up sides to
back, and when couples meet at C B march in
fours to C F. First four turn to R F, second
four to L F, etc. March up sides to back.</p>

<p>When the fours meet at C B, form eights
and march toward front and halt for drill.
During the march they “carry brooms” in
the right hand, the stick resting against the
right shoulder and nearly vertical, the arm
hanging at nearly its full length near the
body, the hand grasping the handle of the
broom just above the sweep (the brush part),
which rests flat against the side of skirt.
The thumb and forefinger must be in front.</p>

<h4>A LOT OF DON’TS.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I believe, if there is one word that grown-up
folks are more fond of using to us little
folks, than any other word in the big dictionary,
it is the word D-o-n-t.</p>

<p>It is all the time “Don’t do this,” and
“Don’t do that,” and “Don’t do the other,”
until I am sometimes afraid there will be
nothing left that we can do.</p>

<p>Why, for years and years and years, ever
since I was a tiny little tot, this word “Don’t”
has been my torment. It’s “Lizzie, don’t
make a noise, you disturb me,” and “Lizzie,
don’t eat so much candy, it will make you
sick,” and “Lizzie, don’t be so idle,” and
“Don’t talk so much,” and “Don’t soil
your clothes,” and “Don’t” everything else.
One day I thought I’d count how many
times I was told not to do things! Just
think! I counted twenty-three “don’ts,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
I think I missed two or three little ones besides.</p>

<p>But now it is my turn. I have got a chance
to talk, and I’m going to tell some of the big
people when to Don’t! That is what my
piece is about. First, I shall tell the papas
and mammas—Don’t scold the children, just
because you have been at a party the night
before, and so feel cross and tired. Second,
Don’t fret and make wrinkles in your faces
over things that cannot be helped. I think
fretting spoils big folks just as much as it
does us little people. Third, Don’t forget
where you put your scissors, and then say you
s’pose the children have taken them. Oh!
I could tell you ever so many “don’ts,” but
I think I’ll only say one more, and that is—Don’t
think I mean to be saucy, because all
these don’ts are in my piece, and I had to
say them.</p>

<h4>THERE IS A TEETOTALER.</h4>

<p>This piece should be spoken by a spirited boy, and
as he goes upon the stage, some one should cry out,
“There’s a teetotaler!”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Yes, sir, here <i>is</i> a teetotaler, from the crown
of his head to the tips of his toes. I’ve got
on teetotal boots, too, that never will walk in
the way of a drunkard. The other day a
man asked me about our White Ribbon
Army. He wanted to know what use there
is in making so many promises. I told him
the use was in <i>keeping</i> the promises more
than in <i>making</i> them.</p>

<p>The boys which belong to our Army have
something to do besides loafing at the corners
of the streets, and smoking the stumps
of cigars they pick out of the gutters. It
makes me sick to think of it!</p>

<p>Some boys are dreadfully afraid of losing
their liberty, so they won’t sign our pledge.
I saw four or five of them the other day.
They had been off, somewhere, having what
they call a jolly time; and they were so
drunk they couldn’t walk straight. They
lifted their feet higher than a sober boy
would to go upstairs, and I watched them
till one fell down and bumped his nose.</p>

<p>Thinks I to myself, there’s liberty for you,
but it’s just such liberty as I don’t want. I
would rather walk straight than crooked, I
would rather stand up than fall down, and I
would rather go to a party with my sisters,
and some other pretty girls, than hide away
with a lot of rough fellows, to guzzle beer
and whisky.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other reasons why I
am a teetotaler. When I grow up, I would
rather be a <i>man</i> than a walking wine-cask or
rum-barrel; I would rather live in a <i>good</i>
house than a <i>poor</i> one, and I would rather be
loved and respected than despised and hated.</p>

<p>Now, if these are not reasons enough for
being a teetotaler, I will give you some more
the next time we meet.</p>

</div>

<h4>AN APPEAL FOR BENEFICENCE.</h4>

<p class="center sm90"><i>For a small boy.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The boy that spoke first to-night said you
were all welcome. I shan’t take it back.
You <i>are</i> welcome. You’re welcome to see
and hear; but you’re just twice as welcome
to <i>give</i>. We love to look at you, and we’re
<i>willing</i> you should look at us. We’re glad
to have you hear <i>us</i>; but we want to hear
<i>you</i>. You haven’t any speeches ready? All
right! We don’t want to hear those. We
can make those ourselves—as you’ve seen.</p>

<p>What we do want to hear is the rustling
of Greenbacks and the clinking of Silver, as
the ushers pass the boxes round. That’s a
kind of music that we appreciate, for it gets us
our library-books, our papers, our banners,
and everything else that a Sunday-School
needs; and then it’s a kind of music that we
can’t make ourselves, and everybody prizes
what he can’t do himself. We do our best now.
This school has given ⸺ dollars for benevolent
objects, during the past year. Isn’t such
a school worth helping? We mean to do better
by-and-by, when <i>we</i> get hold of the money-bags.
Just now, <i>you</i> must do the giving.</p>

</div>

<h4>ADDRESS OF WELCOME TO A NEW PASTOR.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">To be spoken by a small girl.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Pastor</span>:—The old folks have asked
you to come and be their pastor, and we
children want to know if you won’t come
and be ours too. I am sure little folks need
a pastor just as much as big ones do. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
think they do more, because big folks ought
to be able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>We think the Sunday-school belongs especially
to us, as we are allowed to say more
there than we are in church, so we would
like you to come into the Sunday-school and
work with us there, and we will gladly pay
you with our love and sunny smiles. (We
can’t give you our pennies because they have
to go across the ocean to the poor heathen.)
If you could only come around through our
classes every week and help us just a little by
a word of good cheer, I am sure we would feel
that you belonged to us and we to you.</p>

<p>I know pastors have an awful lot to do,
and they say it is real hard work to preach,
but if you could say just a little less to the
old folks, and a little more to the young
folks, we will help you build up the church
and make it a big success. So, I hope, dear
pastor, you will let us call you our own, and
when you come among us you may be sure
we will love you and welcome you as the
children’s friend.</p>

</div>

<h4>ADDRESS OF WELCOME TO A NEW
SUPERINTENDENT.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">To be spoken by a small boy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Blank</span>:—I am sent out here
to-day to tell you how glad we are that you
are to be our new superintendent. I welcome
you in the name of the school, and do it most
heartily. Boys know a good thing when
they see it—if they didn’t Farmer Jones
wouldn’t have to put up sticky fly-paper on
his peach trees—just to catch flies, of course.
So, when we were told that you had been
chosen for our new superintendent, we said
“that’s all right.”</p>

<p>There must be an engineer to every train
if it is to be run properly, at the same time a
great deal depends on the train and how it is
made up. Now, I believe there is good
stuff in our Sunday-school. We would
make a good train if guided by a good engineer.
We can’t run ourselves and keep on
the track, that’s sure. We are quite certain,
to begin with, that we are on the right track,
and we know that Mr. Blank can keep us
there. To get to the end of our journey
safely, though, will depend much on how well
our train hangs together. This, boys and
girls, is our part, and we must do our best.</p>

<p>We know that love will make the wheels
go round and charity will bind us together,
tighter than any cord. We hope our engineer
will be proud of his train.</p>

</div>

<h4>OPENING ADDRESS FOR A SUNDAY-SCHOOL EXHIBITION.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have always been told that children
should be seen and not heard, but this is
children’s night and we are going to be seen
and heard too.</p>

<p>We are very glad to welcome the old
folks. There are so many here their presence
would lead us to think they believe
boys and girls can do something after all.
Their eyes are on us, and I hope, children,
that you have brought your best behavior
with you, because this is a good time and
place to use it. Perhaps I may be allowed
to suggest that you keep your eye on the
old folks, just to see that they conduct themselves
properly.</p>

<p>Boys and girls, we have a great deal to
say that is worth hearing, and I hope you
will speak out loud and prompt so that our
audience will not miss any of the good
things. We want to make this the best
exhibition we have ever given, so that when
our elders go home they will have a better
impression of us than they ever had before.</p>

</div>

<h4>CLOSING ADDRESS FOR A SUNDAY-SCHOOL EXHIBITION.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When I found that our superintendent had
put me <i>last</i> on the programme, I felt, as boys
often do, that it would be much nicer to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
<i>first</i>, but he said it was a good plan to keep
the best wine till the last, so I feel all right
about it. I know, too, that you will not
question the superintendent’s good taste. I
mean about <i>me</i>, not the <i>wine</i>. He wants me
to say we are all very much obliged to you
for coming, and we hope you have had a
much bigger treat than you expected.</p>

<p>These exhibitions mean work for the boys
and girls, as well as for the teachers, but
<i>work</i> does everybody good, especially boys
who love base-ball better than Sunday-school.
I hope our efforts have been a
credit to ourselves and to the Sunday-school,
of which we are all so proud.</p>

<h4>PRESENTATION ADDRESS TO A PASTOR.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">For a young lady.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Pastor</span>:—It is our delight at this
season of gifts and good will, to present to
you a slight token of the esteem in which
you are held by your Sunday School. To
say we all love you is to repeat what you
must already know.</p>

<p>“Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth
speaketh,” but words do not always answer
our purpose. We like to put them into some
tangible form, and so to-night we present you
with this ⸺ which comes as an expression
of our sincere love and good wishes.</p>

<p>We ask you to accept this, not for its intrinsic
value, but as a gift from loyal scholars,
who recognize and appreciate your constant
and untiring efforts to minister to their needs
in every way and at all times.</p>

<p>Do not thank us, dear Pastor. We are
discharging but a mite of the indebtedness we
owe you, and you will only add to that debt if
you persist in returning thanks to us. You
know how Church people abhor debts, and we
are trying to put into practice some of your
preaching. We hope the token will be a constant
reminder, if that were necessary, of our
unceasing interest in you and your work.</p>

</div>

<h4>A PRESENTATION ADDRESS TO A TEACHER.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Teacher</span>:—We take this occasion
to acknowledge publicly our deep and sincere
appreciation of the faithful service you
have rendered us. It is our desire to tender
you some tangible expression of the sincere
feeling we have for you and to impress upon
you the love and good will felt by every
pupil.</p>

<p>I, therefore, present you this ⸺ asking
you to associate it forever with the names
and faces of the donors. Through your
kind and prayerful aid many of us have
been led into the way of truth, and will,
therefore, gratefully remember you as long
as we live.</p>

</div>

<h4>A PRESENTATION ADDRESS TO A SUPERINTENDENT.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">For a young man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Superintendent</span>:—We are going to
make you a present to-night, and I for one
think you deserve it.</p>

<p>Our School has the reputation of being a
<i>live</i> one, and it is a good deal because there
is a <i>live</i> man at the head of it. In the past
year that you have been with us, your patience
must have been sorely tried, for while
most of the children are naturally good, some
are naturally unruly. The young men and
young women from whom we expect the best
conduct are often, strange to say, more attentive
to each other than to their lessons. But
having been first a boy yourself, and perhaps
later a beau, you have not had the heart to
be too severe on those who are still young
pupils in the school of experience.</p>

<p>By your untiring efforts you have brought
the Sunday School up to a standard of unusual
excellence. For its free and vigorous
life, we are largely indebted to you. As a
token of that fact please accept this gift. We
wish its intrinsic value were twice as great.
But if it conveys, even in a slight degree, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
esteem in which you are held by all our
scholars, young and old, it will serve the purpose
for which it was procured.</p>

</div>

<h4>ADDRESS OF WELCOME AFTER ILLNESS.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">To be spoken by a young lady.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Blank</span>:—I feel unable to fully
express to you our joy at seeing you once
more in your place in the Sunday School.
It has been hard for us to be deprived of your
presence, for you had made yourself invaluable
to us, but added to the personal loss we
felt at your absence was the greater sorrow
that you had been called upon to pass through
so much physical suffering.</p>

<p>But, we know that God’s hand is always
leading us, and the same wise purpose that
causes the shadows to fall, also makes the
sun to shine, and “the darker the shadow,
the brighter the sunshine.” When, for a time,
it was feared that you might not be restored
to us, we felt we could not have it so, but
our prayers were heard, and our thanks are
deep and sincere that you are again in our
midst. We pray that you may long be permitted
to glorify Him who is the great physician,
in the work to which you are returned.</p>

</div>

<h4>ADDRESS OF WELCOME AFTER ABSENCE.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">To be spoken by a young man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Pastor</span>:—I want to speak in behalf
of the younger members of your flock and
add our hearty welcome to that already voiced
by our elders. We congratulate you on your
safe return, and rejoice with you that change
and rest have reinvigorated your physical
health. As you come, bringing the fresh
fruits of added experience and observation,
you will find us all eager to benefit by what
has enriched your store.</p>

<p>Welcome home, then, to all that has suffered
by your absence. The Church with its
manifold offices has often felt the need of
your strength and wisdom. Welcome to the
Sunday-school where your words of help and
counsel have guided us many times, and
where your presence has been most uplifting.</p>

<p>Welcome to the homes and hearts of the
young and old alike. There is not a fireside
in our midst that has not been cheered by
your frequent and timely visits. In the seasons
of joy and sorrow which must come to
all homes alike, there has been no one to
whom we could turn and be so sure of loving
sympathy as yourself.</p>

<p>Welcome to the privileges and responsibilities
of your calling and to the honor of
your old title—The Pastor who loves the
children. We want to give fresh assurance
of our hearty co-operation in that work which
you are about to resume. We have learned
in your absence how much and how great is
that work.</p>

<p>Let it be our privilege to share it with you
and so prove by our deeds, the love we have
for your labors.</p>

<p>The following programme can be varied as occasion may require by
additional exercises or by substituting others for those here suggested.
The platform should be decorated with flags and patriotic emblems. In
addition to the singing of patriotic airs, there should be music by a
band or orchestra. Each of the children should be furnished with a small
flag. Let all the exercises be very spirited.</p>

<h5>DECLAMATION—The Little Mayflower.</h5>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">And now—for the fulness of time is
come—let us go up, in imagination
to yonder hill, and look out upon
the November scene. That single
dark speck, just discernible through the perspective
glass, on the waste of waters, is the
fated vessel. The storm moans through her
tattered canvas, as she creeps, almost sinking,
to her anchorage in Provincetown harbor;
and there she lies, with all her treasures, not
of silver and gold (for of these she has none),
but of courage, of patience, of zeal, of high
spiritual daring.</p>

<p>So often as I dwell in imagination on this
scene; when I consider the condition of the
Mayflower, utterly incapable, as she was, of
living through another gale; when I survey
the terrible front presented by our coast to
the navigator who, unacquainted with its
channels and roadsteads, should approach
it in the stormy season, I dare not call
it a mere piece of good fortune, that the
general north and south wall of the shore
of New England should be broken by this
extraordinary projection of the cape, running
out into the ocean a hundred miles,
as if on purpose to receive and encircle the
precious vessel.</p>

<p>As I now see her, freighted with the destinies
of a continent, barely escaped from
the perils of the deep, approaching the shore
precisely where the broad sweep of this
most remarkable headland presents almost
the only point at which, for hundreds of
miles, she could, with any ease, have made
a harbor, and this, perhaps, the very best on
the seaboard, I feel my spirit raised above
the sphere of mere natural agencies.</p>

<p>I see the mountains of New England rising
from their rocky thrones. They rush forward
into the ocean, settling down as they
advance; and there they range themselves,
as a mighty bulwark around the heaven-directed
vessel. Yes, the everlasting God
himself stretches out the arm of his mercy
and his power, in substantial manifestation,
and gathers the meek company of his worshipers
as in the hollow of his hand.</p>

the year 1768, the people of Boston resolved that
they would not import any tea, glass, paper, or other
commodities commonly brought from Great Britain,
until the act imposing duties upon all such articles
should be repealed. This poetical appeal to the ladies
of the country, to lend a ‘helping hand’ for the
furtherance of that resolution, appeared in the Boston

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">What has this nation done to repay
the world for the benefits we have
received from others? We have
been repeatedly told, and sometimes, too,
in a tone of affected impartiality, that the
highest praise which can fairly be given
to the American mind, is that of possessing
an enlightened selfishness; that if the philosophy
and talents of this country, with all
their effects, were forever swept into oblivion,
the loss would be felt only by ourselves; and
that if to the accuracy of this general charge,
the labors of Franklin present an illustrious,
it is still but a solitary, exception.</p>

<p>The answer may be given, confidently and
triumphantly. Without abandoning the fame
of our eminent men, whom Europe has been
slow and reluctant to honor, we would reply,
that the intellectual power of this people has
exerted itself in conformity to the general
system of our institutions and manners; and
therefore, that, for the proof of its existence
and the measure of its force, we must look
not so much to the works of prominent individuals,
as to the great aggregate results;
and if Europe has hitherto been wilfully
blind to the value of our example and the
exploits of our sagacity, courage, invention,
and freedom, the blame must rest with her,
and not with America.</p>

<p>Is it nothing for the universal good of
mankind to have carried into successful operation
a system of self-government, uniting
personal liberty, freedom of opinion, and
equality of rights, with national power and
dignity; such as had before existed only in
the Utopian dreams of philosophers? Is it
nothing, in moral science, to have anticipated
in sober reality, numerous plans of reform
in civil and criminal jurisprudence, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
are, but now, received as plausible theories
by the politicians and economists of Europe?
Is it nothing to have been able to call forth
on every emergency, either in war or peace,
a body of talented patriots always equal to
the difficulty?</p>

<p>Is it nothing to have, in less than a half-century,
exceedingly improved the sciences
of political economy, of law, and of medicine,
with all their auxiliary branches; to have
enriched human knowledge by the accumulation
of a great mass of useful facts and
observations, and to have augmented the
power and the comforts of civilized man, by
miracles of mechanical invention? Is it
nothing to have given the world examples of
disinterested patriotism, of political wisdom,
of public virtue; of learning, eloquence,
and valor, never exerted save for some
praiseworthy end? It is sufficient to have
briefly suggested these considerations; every
mind would anticipate me in filling up the
details.</p>

<p>No—Land of Liberty! thy children have
no cause to blush for thee. What though the
arts have reared few monuments among us,
and scarce a trace of the muse’s footstep is
found in the paths of our forests, or along
the banks of our rivers; yet our soil has
been consecrated by the blood of heroes, and
by great and holy deeds of peace. Its wide
extent has become one vast temple and hallowed
asylum, sanctified by the prayers and
blessings of the persecuted of every sect, and
the wretched of all nations.</p>

<p>Land of Refuge—Land of Benedictions!
Those prayers still arise, and they still are
heard: “May peace be within thy walls, and
plenteousness within thy palaces!” “May
there be no decay, no leading into captivity,
and no complaining in thy streets!” “May
truth flourish out of the earth, and righteousness
look down from Heaven!”</p>

<h4>PROGRAMME FOR DECORATION DAY.</h4>

<p class="center sm90">(Music by band or orchestra can be introduced whenever deemed appropriate).</p>

<h5>SINGING—“Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean.”</h5>

<h5>DECLAMATION—The Meaning of the Day.</h5>

<p>All over our land, in every cemetery
where rests members of our army of
the dead—and we doubt if any
burial place has not such sleepers,—people
are gathered to-day to pay tribute
to our soldier dead and strew flowers over
their graves. All hearts turn as by a common
impulse to these ceremonies. We bring
our offerings of flowers to the soldiers, but
it affects them not; they cannot feel the love
and gratitude that prompt the gift. Their
lives and deeds have wrought for themselves
more enduring monuments than sculptured
marble. We assure the loving soldiers that
they are not forgotten—that their courage
and patriotism will always be remembered as
long as a loyal school boy or school girl may
live. But this day means more than this, it
means something for our nation, something
for posterity; its belief in that grand old flag
and what it stands for; a belief in freedom.
It means that the boys and girls of to-day,
the men and women of to-morrow, who share
in this day’s ceremonies, echo the words of our
fathers, that “this government shall be preserved,
come what will, threaten it who may.”</p>

<h5>EXERCISE.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(For fifteen pupils each carrying a flag, and gesturing
as indicated. Pupil 8 should carry a larger
flag than the others. Seven to the left of eight should
hold flags to left shoulder; seven to right of eight,
should hold flags to right shoulder. When the word
<i>North</i> is recited, the seven to the right of number
eight raise their flags, then back to the shoulder;
when the word <i>South</i> is recited, the seven to the left
of number eight lift their flags, then replace to shoulders.
Each might carry in other hand a bunch of
flowers, and at the word <i>flowers</i>, the bouquets should
be raised as were the flags. The pupils to the left
could wear gray and those to the right, blue, in some
way—in caps, sashes or bows. Number eight should
be dressed in red, white and blue.)</p>

<h5>PAPER—Origin of Memorial Day.</h5>

<p>General John Murray was the
originator of Memorial Day in the
North. While visiting in the South
in the winter of 1867-’68, he noticed the
touching rite of decorating soldiers’ graves
with flowers by the ladies. Being very much
impressed with this custom, he instituted a
similar one at his own home.</p>

<p>On the 5th day of May, 1868, Gen. John
A. Logan, who was then Commander-in-chief
of the Grand Army of the Republic,
established Decoration Day, and by a general
order, May 30, 1868, was designated as
a day set apart for the purpose of paying tribute
to the memory of those brave men who
died in defense of our country. The national
encampment held in Washington had
it incorporated in its rules and regulations,
May 11, 1870. Since then, in many of the
States, May 30th has been established as a
holiday, and it is the universal custom to
decorate the graves of all ex-soldiers, thus
making it one of the most patriotic days of
the year, wherein all classes unite in paying
honor to our heroic dead, and feel a conscious
pride in being able to thus show respect
for their memory and the cause for
which they fought.</p>

<h5>SONG:—“The Star Spangled Banner.”</h5>

<h5>EXERCISE.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(A large urn or vase is placed on a stand decorated
with the national colors and a bow of black ribbon.
Around the rim of the vase a beautiful wreath should
be placed. The stand should be at the front of the
rostrum, so the pupils may pass behind it. The pupils
representing the various wars should be dressed
if possible in the costumes of that day—military costumes.
Beside the urn, a girl representing Liberty
should stand holding a large flag at half-mast, she
should dress in white and wear sash of the national
colors. After reciting, each pupil stands in rear of
Liberty. When coming upon the stage, each pupil
salutes the flag before reciting and stands on opposite
side of urn while reciting. When through,
he gracefully deposits his bouquet into the urn. At
close of exercise the school arises and salutes the
flag and repeats the pledge.)</p>

powers, in the field; to which again he offered
the counsels of his wisdom and his experience,
as President of the Convention that
framed our Constitution; which he guided
and directed while in the Chair of State, and
for which the last prayer of his earthly supplication
was offered up, when it came the
moment for him so well, and so grandly, and
I so calmly, to die. He was the first man of
the time in which he grew. His memory is
I first and most sacred in our love; and ever
hereafter, till the last drop of blood shall
freeze in the last American heart, his name
shall be a spell of power and might.</p>

<p>Yes, there is one personal, one vast felicity,
which no man can share with him. It was
the daily beauty and towering and matchless
glory of his life, which enabled him to create
his country, and, at the same time, secure an
undying love and regard from the whole
American people. “The first in the hearts
of his countrymen!” Yes, first! He has
our first and most fervent love. Undoubtedly
there were brave and wise and good men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
before his day, in every colony. But the
American Nation, as a Nation, I do not
reckon to have begun before 1774. And
the first love of that young America was
Washington. The first word she lisped
was his name. Her earliest breath spoke
it. It still is her proud ejaculation; and
it will be the last gasp of her expiring
life!</p>

<p>Yes, others of our great men have been
appreciated—many admired by all. But him
we love. Him we all love. About and
around him we call up no dissentient and discordant
and dissatisfied elements—no sectional
prejudice nor bias,—no party, no creed,
no dogma of politics. None of these shall
assail him. Yes, when the storm of battle
blows darkest and rages highest, the memory
of Washington shall nerve every American
arm, and cheer every American heart. It
shall relume that Promethean fire, that sublime
flame of patriotism, that devoted love of
country, which his words have commended,
which his example has consecrated. Well
did Lord Byron write:</p>

<h4>PROGRAMME FOR ARBOR DAY.</h4>

<p>The celebration of Arbor Day has become so common that there is a demand
for a programme of public exercises for schools and academies. The
following can be varied by omitting pieces or substituting others. Little
flags on palm-leaf fans tacked on well, also tufts of pine, and wreaths
of flowers, bouquets, etc., might aid in decoration. Let the pupils take
an active part in preparation.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Arbor Day is an anniversary that
looks forward with bright hope.
The trees which we plant to-day,
will grow into groves and forests of the future,
and in their silent beauty and voiceless
green will honor the hands that so tenderly
planted them. Beneath them the youth yet
to be may meet in social banquet, and enjoy
the fruitage of our labors.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“We are what wind and sun and water make us,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fashion and win their nurslings with their smiles.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not a holiday; but a day especially
set apart for the purpose of tree-planting, of
observing more closely and studying more
carefully the trees, flowers and gifts of the
forest; also of cultivating a greater reverence
and finer sense of the beautiful and sublime.</p>

<p>What object can better inspire us to gain
victory over trials than the grand old oak
which in bold defiance to its foes while reeling
in the wrath of the tempest is sending
down to deeper hold its gnarled roots only
to be better able to triumph in the next
storm? Our poets have used their purest
thought, their sweetest music in praise of
the forest and the flowers. Arbor Day provides
gracious means of a closer acquaintance
with “God’s first temples,” and we hope that
this day’s effort may result in much good.</p>

<h5>PAPER—Origin of Arbor Day.</h5>

<p>At an annual meeting of the Nebraska
State Board of Agriculture, held in the city
of Lincoln, January 4, 1872, Hon. J. Sterling
Morton introduced the following resolution
which was unanimously adopted after a short
debate as to the name; some desired to call
the day “Sylvan” instead of “Arbor:”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, “That Wednesday, the 10th
day of April, 1872, be, and the same is
hereby especially set apart and consecrated
for tree planting in the State of Nebraska,
and the State Board of Agriculture hereby
name it <i>Arbor Day</i>, and urge upon the people
of the State the vital importance of tree
planting, and hereby offer a special premium
of one hundred dollars to the agricultural
society of that county in Nebraska which
shall upon that day plant properly the largest
number of trees; and a farm library of
twenty-five dollars’ worth of books to that
person, who, on that day, shall plant properly
in Nebraska the greatest number of trees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span></p>

<p>The result was that over a million trees
were planted in Nebraska on that first Arbor
Day. A few years later, April 22, the birthday
of Mr. Morton was set apart by the
Governor as Arbor Day in that State, and
now nearly all States observe Arbor Day.</p>

<h5>RECITATION—Value of Our Forests.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(The pupils come on the stage, one at a time, and
recite, showing the article about which they speak
and give motions.)</p>

</div>

<p><i>1st Pupil</i> (carrying a bunch of toothpicks).</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="125" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A Toothpick is a little thing, yet it
is reported that one factory
uses 10,000 cords of wood annually
in the production of these splints
of wood.</p>

<p><i>2d Pupil</i> (carrying a box of pegs).</p>

<p>Shoe pegs are small affairs; yet a single
factory sends to Europe annually 40,000
bushels of pegs, besides what it sells in this
country.</p>

<p><i>3d Pupil.</i></p>

<p>A spool is of small account when the
thread is wound off; yet several factories use
each from 1800 to 3500 cords of wood every
year in making these articles. Thousands of
acres of birch trees have been bought at one
time by thread manufacturers, for the sole
purpose of securing a supply of spools.</p>

<p><i>4th Pupil.</i></p>

<p>Who thinks much of the little friction
match, as he uses it to light the lamp or fire,
and then throws it away? But one factory, it
is said, makes 60,000,000 of these little articles
every day, and uses for this purpose
12,000 square feet of best pine lumber.</p>

<p><i>5th Pupil.</i></p>

<p>Forests affect the climate of the country;
influence the rain of a country; build up a
wall and protect the crops; they keep the
air pure. The leaf-mold in forests holds
back the rains. We draw $700,000,000
worth of products every year from the trees.
No other crop equals this in value.</p>

<h5>ORATION—The Nobility of Labor.</h5>

<p>I call upon those whom I address to
stand up for the nobility of labor. It
is Heaven’s great ordinance for human
improvement. Let not that great ordinance
be broken down. What do I say? It is
broken down; and it has been broken down
for ages. Let it, then, be built up again;
here, if anywhere, on these shores of a new
world—of a new civilization. But how, I
may be asked, is it broken down? Do not
men toil? it may be said. They do, indeed,
toil; but they, too, generally do it because
they must. Many submit to it as, in some
sort, a degrading necessity; and they desire
nothing so much on earth as escape from it.
They fulfill the great law of labor in the
letter, but break it in the spirit; fulfill it with
the muscle, but break it with the mind.</p>

<p>To some field of labor, mental or manual,
every idler should fasten, as a chosen and
coveted theatre of improvement. But so is
he not impelled to do, under the teachings
of our imperfect civilization. On the contrary,
he sits down, folds his hands, and
blesses himself in his idleness. This way of
thinking is the heritage of the absurd and
unjust feudal system, under which serfs labored,
and gentlemen spent their lives in
fighting and feasting. It is time that this
opprobrium of toil were done away with.</p>

<p>Ashamed to toil, art thou? Ashamed of
thy dingy workshop and dusty labor-field;
of thy hard hands, scarred with service
more honorable than that of war; of thy
soiled and weather-stained garments, on
which Mother Nature has embroidered,
’midst sun and rain, ’midst fire and steam,
her own heraldic honors? Ashamed of these
tokens and titles, and envious of the flaunting
robes of imbecile idleness and vanity?
It is treason to nature—it is impiety to
Heaven—it is breaking Heaven’s great ordinance.
<span class="smcap">Toil</span>, I repeat—<span class="smcap">toil</span>, either of the
brain, or of the heart, or of the hand, is the
only true manhood, the only true nobility!</p>

<h4>PROGRAMME FOR LYCEUM OR PARLOR ENTERTAINMENT.</h4>

<h5>MUSIC—Piano Solo.</h5>

<h5>SONG—Selected by Quartette.</h5>

<h5>SALUTATORY ADDRESS.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(The following speech should be delivered by a
droll boy who can keep his face straight while others
do the laughing. He should act out the spirit of the
piece with appropriate gestures.)</p>

</div>

<p>I am requested to open our performances
by a salutatory address. It needs but
one honest Saxon word for that—one
homely pertinent word; but before I utter a
pertinent word, allow me, like other great
speakers, to indulge in a few <i>im</i>pertinent
words.</p>

<p>And first, let me ask if there is a critic
among us; for this is a sort of family gathering.
We allow no critics! No reporters! No
interviewers! (Do I see a boy taking notes?
Put him out. No! It’s a false alarm, I believe.)</p>

<p>Pardon me if, with the help of my mother’s
eye-glass (<i>lifts eye-glasses</i>), I look round on
your phys—phys—physiognomies. (That’s
the word, I’m very certain, for I practiced on
it a good half hour.) Without flattery I say
it, I like your countenances—with one exception.</p>

<p>A critic! If there is anything I detest it
is a critic. One who cannot bear a little
nonsense, and who shakes his head at a little
salutary (not salutatory) fun. Salutary fun?
Did anybody hiss? Point him out. (<i>Speaker
folds his arms, advances, fixes his eyes on some
one in the audience, and shakes his fist at him.</i>)
Yes, sir, I said salutary fun. Salutary! You
needn’t put on such a grave look. Salutary!
You needn’t sneer at that ep—ep—epithet.
(Yes, I’m quite positive that’s the word I
was drilled on. Epi—<i>thet</i>! That’s it.)</p>

<p>But I was speaking of critics. If there is
any one of that tribe in this assembly—any
dear friend of Cæsar—I mean any stupid
friend of Pompey, no, of pomposity—to him
I say—no, to you I say—Go mark him well;
for him no minstrel raptures swell; despite
his titles, power and pelf, the wretch (rather
rough on him, that!)—the wretch, concentred
all in self, living shall forfeit fair renown, and,
doubly dying, shall go down to the vile dust
from whence he sprung, unwept, unhonored,
and unsung.</p>

<p>There! If any member of Congress could
do it better, bring him on. Excuse me if I
sop my brow. (<i>Wiping it with handkerchief.</i>)</p>

<p>But enough! Let us now put by the cap
and bells. Enough of nonsense! As a great
philosopher, who had been frolicking, once
said: “Hush! Let us be grave! Here
comes a fool.” Nothing personal, sir, in
that! Let us be grave.</p>

<p>And so friends, relatives, ladies, and gentlemen,
I shall conclude by uttering from an
overflowing heart that one word to which I
alluded at the beginning—that one pertinent
Saxon word; that is—(<i>flourishes his hand as
if about to utter it; then suddenly puts his hand
to his forehead as if trying to remember</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span></p>

<p>Forgotten? Confusion! Not a big word
either! Not half as big as some I have
spoken! What—where—when—whence—what
has become of it? Must I break down,
after all? Must I retire in disgrace from
public life? Never! I have it. Here it is!
Here it is in big capitals: WELCOME!</p>

<h5>RECITATION—Mrs. Piper.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(Suited for a young lady. She should appear very
innocent at the beginning, and speak in a droll, unsuspecting
voice and manner. Toward the end she
should exhibit an uncontrollable delight, at the same
time manifest a disposition to conceal it.)</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Good morning, Cousin Laura! I
have a word to say to you.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Only a word! It is yet
half an hour to school-time, and I can listen.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> I saw you yesterday speaking to that
fellow Sterling—Frank Sterling.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Of course I spoke to Frank. What
then? Is he too good to be spoken to?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Far from it. You must give up his
acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Indeed, Cousin Ralph! I must give
up his acquaintance? On what compulsion
<i>must</i> I?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> If you do not wish to be cut by all the
boys of the academy, you must cut Frank.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Cut! What do you mean by <i>cut</i>?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> By cutting, I mean not recognizing an
individual. When a boy who knows you
passes you without speaking or bowing, he
cuts you.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> I thank you for the explanation. And
I am to understand that I must either give
up the acquaintance of my friend Frank, or
submit to the terrible mortification of being
“cut” by Mr. Ralph Burton and his companions!</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Certainly. Frank is a boy of no spirit—in
short, a coward.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> How has he shown it?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Why, a dozen boys have dared him to
fight, and he refuses to do it.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> And is your test of courage a willingness
to fight? If so, a bull-dog is the most
courageous of gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> I am serious, Laura; you must give
him up. Why, the other day Tom Harding
put a chip on a fellow’s hat, and dared Frank
Sterling to knock it off. But Sterling folded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
his arms and walked off, while we all groaned
and hissed.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> You did? You groaned and hissed?
Oh, Ralph, I did not believe you had so little
of the true gentleman about you!</p>

<p><i>R.</i> What do you mean? Come, now, I do
not like that.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Were you at the great fire last night?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Yes; Tom Harding and I helped work
one of the engines.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Did you see that boy go up the ladder?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Yes; wouldn’t I like to be in his shoes!
They say the Humane Society are going to
give him a medal; for he saved a baby’s life
and no mistake—at the risk of his own, too;
everybody said so; for the ladder he went
up was all charred and weakened, and it
broke short off before he got to the ground.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> What boy was it!</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Nobody could find out, but I suppose
the morning paper will tell us all about it.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> I have a copy. Here’s the account;
“Great fire; house tenanted by poor families;
baby left in one of the upper rooms; ladder
much charred; firemen too heavy to go up;
boy came forward, ran up; seized an infant;
descended safely; gave it into arms of frantic
mother.”</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Is the boy’s name mentioned?</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Ay! Here it is! Here it is! And
who do you think he is?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Do not keep me in suspense.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Well, then, he’s the boy who was so
afraid of knocking a chip off your hat—Frank
Sterling—the coward, as <i>you</i> called
him.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> No! Let me see the paper for myself.
There’s the name, sure enough, printed in
capital letters.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> But, cousin, how much more illustrious
an achievement it would have been for him
to have knocked a chip off your hat! Risking
his life to save a chip of a baby was a
small matter compared with that. Can the
gratitude of a mother for saving her baby
make amends for the ignominy of being cut
by Mr. Tom Harding and Mr. Ralph Burton?</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Don’t laugh at me any more, Cousin
Laura. I see I have been stupidly in the
wrong. Frank Sterling is no coward. I’ll
ask his pardon this very day.</p>

<p><i>L.</i> Will you? My dear Ralph, you will
in that case show that you are not without
courage.</p>

<h5>ORATION—The Spanish-American War.</h5>

<p>It is gratifying to all of us to know that
this has never ceased to be a war of
humanity. The last ship that went out
of the harbor of Havana before war was declared
was an American ship that had taken
to the suffering people of Cuba the supplies
furnished by American charity, and the first
ship to sail into the harbor of Santiago was
an American ship bearing food supplies to
the suffering Cubans, and I am sure it is the
universal prayer of American citizens that justice
and humanity and civilization shall characterize
the final settlement of peace, as they
have distinguished the progress of the war.</p>

<p>My countrymen, the currents of destiny flow
through the hearts of our people. Who will
check them, who will divert them, who will stop
them? And the movements of men, planned
and designed by the Master of Men, will never
be interrupted by the American people.</p>

<p>I witness with pride and satisfaction the
cheers of the multitudes as the veterans of the
civil war on both sides of the contest are reviewed.
I witness with increasing pride the
wild acclaim of the people as you watch the
volunteers and the regulars and our naval
reserves (the guardians of the people on land
and sea) pass before your eyes, for I read in
the faces and hearts of my countrymen the
purpose to see to it that this government,
with its free institutions, shall never perish
from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>My heart is filled with gratitude to the
God of battles, who has so favored us, and to
the soldiers and sailors who have won such
victories on land and sea and have given
such a new meaning to American valor. No
braver soldiers or sailors ever assembled
under any flag.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the American people are
ready. If the Merrimac is to be sunk in
the mouth of the Santiago harbor to prevent
the escape of the Spanish fleet, a brave young
hero is ready to do it and to succeed in what
his foes have never been able to do—sink
an American ship. All honor to the army
and navy, without whose sacrifices we could
not celebrate the victory. The flag of our
country is safe in the hands of our patriots
and heroes.</p>

<h5>ORATION—The Laboring Classes.</h5>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Sir, it is an insult to our laboring
classes to compare them to the
debased poor of Europe. Why,
sir, we of this country do not know what
poverty is. We have no poor in this country,
in the sense in which that word is used abroad.
Every laborer, even the most humble, in the
United States, soon becomes a capitalist, and
even, if he choose, a proprietor of land; for
the West, with all its boundless fertility, is
open to him.</p>

<p>How can any one dare compare the mechanic
of this land (whose inferiority, in any
substantial particular, in intelligence, in virtue,
in wealth, to the other classes of our society,
I have yet to learn) with that race of outcasts,
of which so terrific a picture is presented by
recent writers—the poor of Europe?—a race
among no inconsiderable portion of whom
famine and pestilence may be said to dwell
continually; many of whom are without
morals, without education, without a country,
without a God! and may be said to know
society only by the terrors of its penal code,
and to live in perpetual war with it. Poor
bondmen! mocked with the name of liberty,
that they may be sometimes tempted to
break their chains, in order that, after a
few days of starvation in idleness and dissipation,
they may be driven back to their
prison-house to take their shackles up again,
heavier and more galling than before; severed,
as it has been touchingly expressed,
from nature, from the common air, and the
light of the sun; knowing only by hearsay
that the fields are green, that the
birds sing, and that there is a perfume in
flowers!</p>

<p>And is it with a race whom the perverse
institutions of Europe have thus degraded
beneath the condition of humanity that the

<h5>RECITATION—Flowers.</h5>

<p>How the universal heart of man blesses
flowers! They are wreathed round
the cradle, the marriage altar, and
the tomb. The Persian in the far
East delights in their perfume, and writes his
love in nosegays; while the Indian child of
the far West clasps his hands with glee as he
gathers the abundant blossoms—the illuminated
scripture of the prairies. The Cupid
of the ancient Hindoos tipped his arrows
with flowers, and orange buds are the bridal
crown with us, a nation of yesterday. Flowers
garlanded the Grecian altar, and they hang in
votive wreaths before the Christian shrine.</p>

<p>All these are appropriate uses. Flowers
should deck the brow of the youthful bride,
for they are in themselves a lovely type of
marriage. They should twine round the
tomb, for their perpetually renewed beauty is
a symbol of the resurrection. They should
festoon the altar, for their fragrance and their
beauty ascend in perpetual worship before
the Most High.</p>

<h5>READING—Summer-Time.</h5>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">They were right—those old German
minnesingers—to sing the pleasant
summer-time! What a time it is!
How June stands illuminated in the calendar!
The windows are all wide open; only
the Venetian blinds closed. Here and there
a long streak of sunshine streams in through
a crevice. We hear the low sound of the
wind among the trees; and, as it swells and
freshens, the distant doors clap to, with a
sudden sound. The trees are heavy with
leaves; and the gardens full of blossoms, red
and white. The whole atmosphere is laden
with perfume and sunshine. The birds sing.
The cock struts about, and crows loftily.
Insects chirp in the grass. Yellow buttercups
stud the green carpet like golden buttons,
and the red blossoms of the clover like
rubies.</p>

<p>The elm-trees reach their long, pendulous
branches almost to the ground. White
clouds sail aloft, and vapors fret the blue sky
with silver threads. The white village
gleams afar against the dark hills. Through
the meadow winds the river—careless, indolent.
It seems to love the country, and is in
no haste to reach the sea. The bee only is
at work—the hot and angry bee. All things
else are at play! he never plays, and is vexed
that any one should.</p>

<p>People drive out from town to breathe,
and to be happy. Most of them have flowers
in their hands; bunches of apple-blossoms,
and still oftener lilacs. Ye denizens of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
crowded city, how pleasant to you is the
change from the sultry streets to the open
fields, fragrant with clover blossoms! how
pleasant the fresh, breezy country air, dashed
with brine from the meadows! how pleasant,
above all, the flowers, the manifold beautiful
flowers!</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Oh, dear, Charles, how sick and tired I
am of housework! I do envy people
who are able to keep help. Here
I am tied up to the little hot kitchen morning
till night—stewing, and baking, and frying,
and scrubbing, and washing floors, till I
am ready to sink! One thing over and over
again. I wonder why Hood, when he wrote
the “Song of the Shirt,” had not kept on and
written the “Song of the Basement Story.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> Is it so very bad, Lily? Why, I
always thought it must be nice work to cook—and
washing dishes is the easiest thing in
the world. All you have to do is to pour a
little hot water over ’em and give ’em a flirt
over with a towel.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> That’s all you men know about
it; it is the hardest work in the world! I
always hated it. I remember, when I was a
little girl, I always used to be taken with a
headache when mother wanted me to wash
the dishes. And then she’d dose me with
rhubarb. Ugh! how bitter it was; but not
half so bitter as washing dishes in boiling
water in a hot kitchen in the middle of
August!</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> (<i>meditatively taking his feet from
the mantel</i>.) I made a lucky sale this morning,
and saved a cool three hundred. I had
intended giving you a new silk, but I’ll do
better—I’ll hire you a girl. How will that
suit?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Oh, what a darling! I would
kiss you if you hadn’t been smoking, and
my collar weren’t quite so fresh. I am afraid
I shall muss it. But you are a good soul,
Charlie; and I shall be so happy. Do you
really mean it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> To be sure.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Won’t Mrs. Fitzjones die of envy?
She puts her washing out, and she’s always
flinging that in my face. I guess the boot
will be on the other foot now! I wonder
what she’ll say when she runs in of a morning
to see what I’m cooking, and finds me in
the parlor hem-stitching a handkerchief, and
my <i>maid</i> attending to things in the kitchen?
But where is a girl to be had? Will you go
to the intelligence office?</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> No; I don’t approve of intelligence
offices. I will advertise. Bring me a
pen and ink, Lily.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>bringing the articles</i>.) You won’t
say that to me any more, Charles. It will
be, “Biddy, my good girl, bring me the writing
implements.” Won’t it be nice? Just
like a novel. They always have servants,
you know.</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> What, the novels?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> No; the people in them. Are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
you writing the advertisement? Be sure and
say that no one need apply except experienced
persons. I want no green hands about
my kitchen.</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> (<i>reads from the paper what he has
been writing</i>.) “Wanted, by a quiet family, a
girl to do general housework. None but
those having had experience need apply. Call
at No. 116 B⸺ street, between the hours
of ten and two.” How will that answer?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Admirably! Charles, you ought
to have been an editor. You express your
ideas so clearly!</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> Thank you, my dear, thank you.
I believe I <i>have</i> some talent for expressing
my meaning. But I am going down town
now, and will have this advertisement inserted
in the <i>Herald</i>, and by to-morrow you
can hold yourself in readiness to receive applicants.
By-bye (<i>goes out</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>alone</i>). If it isn’t the most charming
thing! Won’t the Fitzjoneses and Mrs.
Smith be raving? Mrs. Smith has got a bound
girl, and Mrs. Fitzjones puts out her washing;
but I am to have a regular servant! I shall get
a chance to practice my music now. Dear me—how
red my hands are! (<i>looks at them</i>) I must
get some cold cream for them; one’s hands
show so on the white keys of a piano. I’ll go
and open that piano now, and dust it. It must
be dreadfully out of tune. But I’ll have it
tuned as soon as ever I get that girl fairly
initiated into my way of doing work (<i>goes out</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging tb"><i>Scene II.</i>—<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Marshall</span> awaiting the coming
of “applicants.” A furious ring at the
front door bell.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>peeping through the blinds</i>). Dear
me! I wonder who’s coming! A person
applying for the situation of servant would
not be likely to come to the front door. I
can just see the edge of a blue-silk flounce,
and a streamer of red ribbon on the bonnet.
I’ll go and see who it is (<i>opens the door, and
a stout Irish girl, gaudily dressed, with an eye-glass,
and a bonnet of enormous dimensions
pushes by her, and entering the parlor, seats
herself in the rocking-chair</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> To what am I indebted for this
visit?</p>

<p><i>Irish Girl.</i> It looks well for the like of yees
to ask! It’s the leddy what’s wanting a
young leddy to help in the wurrk that I’m
after seeing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). I am that person,
if you please. What may I call your name?</p>

<p><i>Irish Girl.</i> Me name’s Margaret O’Flanagan,
though some people has the impudence
to call me Peggy; but if ever the likes of it
happens agin I’ll make the daylight shine
into ’em where it never dramed of shining
before. What may your name be, mum?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> My name is Marshall. I am in
want of a servant.</p>

<p><i>Margaret.</i> Sarvint, is it? Never a bit of a
sarvint will I be for anybody! The blud of
my forefathy would cry out against it. But
I might have ixpected it from the appearance
of yees. Shure, and I’d no other thought
but ye was the chambermaid. Marshall, is
it? Holy St. Patrick! why that was the
name of the man that was hung in County
Cork for the murthering of Dennis McMurphy,
and he had a nose exactly like the one
foreninst your face. (<i>A second ring at the door.
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Marshall</span> ushers in a stolid-faced German
girl, and an over-dressed colored lady.
They take seats on the sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><i>German Girl.</i> Ish dis the place mit the woman
what wants a girl in her housework that
was put into de paper day pefore to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Yes, I am the woman. What is
your name?</p>

<p><i>German Girl.</i> Katrina Van Follenstein. I
can do leetle of most everything. I can bake
all myself, and bile, and fry; and makes sourkrout—oh,
sphlendid! And I sphanks the
children as well as their own mudders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span></p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> If ye’ll condescend to lave that dirty
Dutchman, young leddy, I’ll be afther asking
ye a few questions; and then if ye don’t shute
me I can be laving. Me time is precious.
Is them the best cheers in yer house?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> They are.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Holy Virgin! Why, mum, I’ve
been used to having better cheers than them
in me own room, and a sofy in me kitchen to
lay me bones on when they’re took aching.
Have ye got a wine cellar?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). No! We are temperance
people.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Oh, botheration! Then ye’ll niver
do for me, at all at all? It’s wine I must
have every day to keep me stummach in
tune, and if Barney O’Grath comes in of an
evening I should die of mortification if I didn’t
have a drop of something to trate him on.
And about the peanny. It’s taking lessons
I am, meself, and if it’s out of kilter, why, it
must be fixed at once. I never could think
of playing on a instrument that was ontuned.
It might spile me voice.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I want no servants in my house
who are taking music lessons. I hire a girl
to do my work—not to dictate to me, and
sit in the parlor.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Ye don’t hire me. No mum! Not
by a long walk. It’s not Margaret O’Flanagan
that’ll be hosted round by an old sharp-nosed
crayter like yerself, wid a mole on yer left
cheek, and yer waterfall made out of other
folks’ hair! The saints be blessed, me own
is an illegant one—and never a dead head was
robbed for to make it! ’Twas the tail of me
cousin Jimmy’s red horse—rest his soul!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>pointing to the door</i>). You can
leave the house, Miss O’Flanagan. You
won’t suit me.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> And you won’t shute me. I wouldn’t
work with ye for a thousand dollars a week!
It’s not low vulgar people that Margaret
O’Flanagan associates with. Good-bye to
ye! I pity the girl ye gets. May the saints
presarve her—and not a drop of wine in the
house! (<i><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Well, Katrina, are you ready to
answer a few questions?</p>

<p><i>Katrina.</i> Yah; I is.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Are you acquainted with general
housework?</p>

<p><i>Kat.</i> Nix; I never have seen that shinneral.
I know Shinneral Shackson, and Shinneral
Grant, but not that one to speak of!</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> M. I intended to ask if you are used
to doing work in the kitchen.</p>

<p><i>Kat.</i> Yaw, I sees. Dat ish my thrade.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Can you cook?</p>

<p><i>Kat.</i> Most people, what bees shenteel,
keeps a cook.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I do not. I shall expect you to
cook. Can you wash?</p>

<p><i>Kat.</i> Beeples that ish in de upper-crust
puts their washing out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Can you make beds, and sweep?</p>

<p><i>Kat.</i> The dust of the fedders sthuffs up my
head, what has got one leetle giutar into it.
Most beeples keeps a chambermaid. Now,
I wants to ask you some tings. You gits up
in morning, and gits breakfast, of course? It
makes mine head ache to git up early. And
you’ll dust all the furnitures, and schrub the
kittles, and your goot man will wash the floors
and pump the water, and make the fires,
and——</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> We shall do no such thing. What
an insolent wretch! You can go at once.
I’ve no further use for you. You won’t suit.</p>

<p><i>Kat.</i> (<i>retreating</i>). Mine krout! what a particular
vomans.</p>

<p><i>Colored Lady.</i> Wall, missis, specks here’s
jest de chile for ye. What wages does you
gib? and what is yer pollyticks?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> What is your name—what
wages do you expect?</p>

<p><i>Colored Lady.</i> My name is Snowdrop
Washington, and I specks five dollars a week<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
if I do my own washing, but if it is put out
to de washerwoman’s wid de rest of de tings,
den I takes off a quarter. And it’s best to
have a fair understanding now, in de beginning.
I’m very particular about my afternoons.
Tuesdays I studies my cataplasin
and can’t be ’sturbed; Wednesdays I goes to
see old Aunt Sally Gumbo, what’s got de
spine of de back; Thursdays I allers takes a
dose of lobeely for me stummuch, and has to
lay abed; and Fridays I ginerally walks out
wid Mr. Sambo Snow, a fren of mine—and
in none of dem cases can I be ’sturbed. And
I shall spect you to find gloves for me to do
de work in; don’t like to sile my hands.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I want to hire a girl to work—every
day—and every hour in the day.</p>

<p><i>Snowdrop.</i> The laws-a-massy! what a missis!
Why, in dat case dis chile haint no
better off dan wite trash! Ketch Snowdrop
Washington setting in that pew! Not dis
nigger. I wish you a berry lubly morning!
(<i>goes out, and a woman clad in widow’s weeds,
and a little boy enter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Woman</i> (<i>in a brisk tone</i>). Are you the person
that wants to hire help? Dear me, don’t
I smell onions! I detest onions! Only vulgar
people eat ’em! Have your children had
the measles? Because I never could think
of taking Freddie where he might be exposed
to that dreadful disease! Freddie, my love,
put down that vase. If you should break
it, you might cut yourself with the pieces.
Have you a dog about the house, marm?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Yes, we have.</p>

<p><i>Woman in Black.</i> Good gracious! he
must be killed then! I shouldn’t see a bit of
comfort if Freddie was where there was a
dog. The last words my dear lamented husband
said to me were these: “Mrs. Bunker,
take care of Freddie.” Bunker’s my name,
marm. Have you a cow?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> We have not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bunker.</i> How unfortunate! Well, I
suppose you can buy one. Freddie depends
so much on his new milk; and so do I.
How many children have you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Three.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Good gracious! what a host! I hope
none of them have bad tempers, or use profane
language. I wouldn’t have Freddie associate
with them for the world if they did. He’s a
perfect cherub in temper. My darling, don’t
pull the cat’s tail! she may scratch you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> You need not remain any longer,
Mrs. Bunker. I do not wish to employ a
maid with a child.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Good heavens! (<i>indignantly</i>).
Whoever saw such a hard-hearted wretch!
Object to my darling Freddie! Did I ever
expect to live to see the day when the offspring
of my beloved Jeremiah would be

<p class="dropcap">Edward, I may just as well say plainly
that I think we must do something to
get your brother off our hands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
He has been here now over two weeks, and
he stays and stays just as if this was his
home, and as if he hadn’t the slightest idea
of ever going away.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> You are quite right, wife; we must
get him away. I thought it possible, when
he came here, that he had plenty of money;
but that idea has vanished entirely. If he
had money, he would not go around so shabbily
dressed. He had the audacity to hint
to me yesterday that I might buy him a new
coat; just as if I hadn’t enough to do to buy
new coats for myself and my children.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Oh! the impudence of some people!
I am sure we have done very well in
keeping him these two weeks, and not charging
him a cent for his boarding. And now
he wants a new coat, does he? I wonder he
didn’t ask for a full suit; he certainly has
need of it; but he needn’t expect to get it
here. But are you <i>sure</i>, Edward, that he
didn’t bring any money home with him?</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Yes, quite sure. I didn’t say anything
to him about it, but John was never
the man to go in rags if he had any money
in his pocket. He has been away for fifteen
years, you know, and he might have made
plenty of money in that time; but it is my
impression, that if he did make anything,
he spent it all before he started for home.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Well, what are we to do with
him?</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Send him to the poor-house, I suppose.
I don’t quite like to do that, either;
for people <i>will</i> talk, and they will say that I
ought to have kept him in his old days.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Let them talk. It’s nobody’s
business but our own, and it will all blow over
in a week or two. Of course we can’t have
him on our hands as long as he lives, merely
because the neighbors will talk a little about
our sending him to the poor-house.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> No, of course not. Here he comes
now; we must inform him of our decision.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">John Simpson</span>, shabbily dressed.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> John, we have been talking about
you.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> So I supposed. I thought I heard
my name mentioned. You were considering
that matter about the coat, were you? I
hope you will think favorably of it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> (<i>bridling up</i>.) No, sir; we were
not thinking of buying you a coat, but we
were speaking of your audacity in making
such a request.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ah! were you? Don’t you see I
am old now, and dreadfully crippled with
rheumatism? And, of course I am not able
to work to buy myself clothes. If my brother
will not take care of me now, who will?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> That’s just what we are going to
talk about.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Wife, allow me to speak to John
about the matter. (<i>To John.</i>) It may sound
a little harsh and unpleasant, but we have
come to the conclusion that we cannot keep
you any longer. You know that we are not
very well off in this world’s goods; we have
not much house-room, and we have three
children that demand our attention. We have
kept you two weeks and we think we have
done very well. We feel that you would be
considerably in our road here, and we have
concluded to send you to the poor-house.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> The poor-house! I always did hate
the poor-house. It must be so lonesome
there; and then, I don’t think the boarding
will be good. Must I go to the poor-house?</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Yes, we have decided. We cannot
keep you.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I thought, when I was away, that if
I could only get home again, I would find
my brother willing to take me under his
roof, and allow me to end my days there.
But I was mistaken. When must I go?</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> I will have the papers made out, and
be ready to take you to-morrow afternoon.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Send for Eliza Jones and her husband.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
They will not want to keep me either,
I suppose—how can I expect them, when
they are a great deal poorer than you? But
send for them. I want to see them, and say
good-bye, before I go away.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Emeline, tell Parker to run across
Jones’ for his Uncle Martin and Aunt Eliza.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit Mrs. S.</i></p>

<p><i>John.</i> If they do not treat me well at the
poor-house, what shall I do? Cut stick and
run off, or sue them for breach of promise?</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> (<i>aside</i>.) It seems to me, he takes it
exceedingly cool. But it is better he should
do so, than to make a noise about it. (<i>To
John.</i>) I think you will be well treated.
The Superintendent is very kind to all under
his care, and is considered a perfect gentleman.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> A gentleman! I’m glad of that.
(<i>Sarcastically.</i>) Ah! Edward, it is a great
thing to be a <i>gentleman</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> I am glad you are willing to go
without making any fuss about it. You know
people <i>will</i> talk; and they would talk a great
deal more, if you should be opposed to going.
I hope you will not think unkindly of us,
because we have concluded to take this step;
you see that we can not well keep you here;
and as you are getting old, and are greatly
afflicted with rheumatism, you will be better
attended to there than you could be here.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, yes, I understand. Don’t fret
about me, Edward. I suppose it isn’t much
difference where I live, and where I end my
days. But, Edward, I <i>think</i> I would not have
treated you so. However, one hardly knows
what one will do when one comes to the pinch.
If I had brought home a market-basket full of
ninety-dollar gold pieces, perhaps I would not
have taken up so much room in your house,
nor crowded your children so dreadfully.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. Simpson</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Jones</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>running to John</i>.) O John, my
brother, they want to send you to the poor-house!
You shall not go! you shall not go!</p>

<p><i>Mr. J.</i> No, John, you shall not go. While
we have a crust of bread, you shall share it
with us.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> But I never did like to eat crusts.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> That’s him, for you! He doesn’t
want to pay anything for his board, but he
wants to have the best.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> And he doesn’t like to eat dirt.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Do you mean to say I am a dirty
cook?</p>

<p><i>John</i> (<i>whistles “Yankee Doodle.”</i>) Come,
if I am to go to the poor-house, let me be off.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> You shall not go. We are poor,
but you shall stay with us. We can find
room for you, and we will be provided for,
I’ll warrant, some way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> People oughtn’t to be rash about
taking on a load they can’t carry.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Emeline, if Martin and Eliza want
to keep John, let them do so; don’t say a
word. Of course, I think they have quite
enough to do to keep their own heads above
water; but if they want to keep John, it is
their own business.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, it is their own business; and
if they were on the point of sinking, would
<i>you</i> raise a finger to keep their heads above
water? <i>No!</i> Edward.—I cannot call you
brother,—I know you now. I leave your
house to-day, but I do not go to the poor-house.
I have money enough to buy and
<i>keep</i> a hundred such little farms as yours,
and a hundred such <i>little men</i>. I do not
need your coats nor your cringing sympathies;
I wanted to know what kind of a man you
were, and <i>I know</i>. When I came home, I
determined to find out, in some way, whether
you or the Jones family were most deserving
of my money. I have found that out; and I
go with them, to make my home there.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> But we didn’t know——</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ay, I know it. You thought I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
a beggar; you thought I had no money and
no clothes. If you had believed otherwise,
you would have received me with open arms.
Come (<i>to Mr. and Mrs. Jones</i>), we will go.
I shall not forget you for your kindness. I
will make my home with you; and if it is
true that you have hard enough work to
keep your heads above water it shall be so
no longer. (<i>To Mr. and Mrs. Simpson.</i>) I
had almost forgotten. Here are twenty dollars,
for my two weeks’ board (<i>throwing down
the bills</i>). You see that although I may have
a <i>shabby appearance</i>, I am yet able to pay my
way in the world. Good-day, Mr. and Mrs.
Simpson.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Beth, I’ll tell you a beautiful story, the
tender story of Joseph.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Joseph who?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He had no other name.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Well, dat’s funny.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Joseph was the son of a good old man,
named Jacob—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I knows him, he saws our wood, an’
he’s dot a wooden leg! What was his last
name?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I don’t know, dear.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Well, dat’s ze same man. Our Jacob
he ain’t dot no ozzer name, either: des
Jacob, old Jacob.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> This good old man had twelve sons.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Any little girls?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Only one.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Huh! I dess she was mighty sorry wiz
such a houseful of boys an’ no little sister.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well, Jacob loved this son very much—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> How much?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, ever so much; more than he could
tell.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Ten hundred thousand bushels?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, and more than that. He bought
him a new coat—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> May Crawford’s dot a new dress, dray
and blue, an’ pearl buttons on it, an’ a new
parasol, and I’m doing to have some new
button shoes as twick as I can kick zese ones
out.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> His father bought him a new coat, a
beautiful coat of many colors—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Oh, ho! des like a bed quilt.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And Joseph was very proud of this
pretty coat—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Huh! I bet you ze boys frowed stones
an’ hollered at him if he wored it to school!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> But his brothers, all of his older brothers,
who—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Did he wear it to school, Aunt Dora?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, I don’t think he did.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I dess he was afraid, and kept it for a
Sunday coat. Did he wear it to Sunday
school?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He didn’t go to one.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Den he was a heathen.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, Joseph wasn’t a heathen.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Den he was a bad boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, indeed; Joseph was a good boy—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Den why didn’t he go to Sunday-school?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No matter. But all his brothers hated
him because his father loved him the best
and—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I spect he always dot the biggest piece
of pie.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And so they wanted to get rid of him,
because—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Den why didn’t zey send him out in
the kitchen to talk with Jenny? Dat’s what
my ma’am does.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And they hated him all the more because
one night, Joseph had a dream—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Oo-oo! I dreamed dot ze big Bible on
ze parlor had five long legs and a mouf full
of sharp teeth, an’ it climbed onto my bed
and drowled at me ’cause I bit ze wax apple
an’ tied gran’pa’s wig onto Carlo’s head last
Sunday! Oh, I was so scared an’ I hollered
an’ ma’am said she dessed I had ze nightmare.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well, one day Joseph’s father sent him
away to see how his brothers were getting
along—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Why didn’t he write ’em a letter?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And when they saw Joseph coming
they said—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Did he ride in ze cars?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, he walked. And when his brothers
saw him coming—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I dess they fought he was a tramp. I
bet you Carlo would have bited his legs if
he’d been zere.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, they knew who he was, but they
were bad, cruel, wicked men, and they took
poor Joseph, who was so good, and who
loved them all so well—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I see a boy climbing our fence! I dess
he’s goin’ to steal our apples. Let’s go sic
Carlo on him.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Poor Joseph, who was only a boy, just
a little boy, who never did any one any harm;
these great rough men seized him with fierce
looks and angry words, and they were going
to kill the frightened, helpless little youth,
who cried and begged them so piteously not
to hurt him; going to kill their own little
brother—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Nellie Taylor has a little brother Jim,
an’ she says she wishes somebody would
kill him when he tears off her doll’s legs an’
frows her kittens in ze cistern.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> But Joseph’s oldest brother pitied the
little boy when he cried—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I dess he wanted some cake; I cry
when I want cake, an’ mamma dives me
some.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And as he wouldn’t let them kill him,
they found a pit—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I like peach pits, an’ I know where I
can find a great lot of ’em now. Come along.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, let’s finish the story first. These
bad men put Joseph in the pit—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Why—Aunt—Dora! What is you
talking about?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> About those cruel men who put Joseph
into the pit—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I dess you mean zey put the pit into
Joseph.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So there the poor little boy was, all
alone in this deep, dark hole—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Why didn’t he climb out?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because he couldn’t. The sides of the
pit were rough, and it was very deep, deep as
a well—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Ding-dong-dell, cat’s in ’e well; oh
auntie, I know a nice story, ’bout a boy that
felled into a cistern and climbed out on a
ladder.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Poor Joseph was sitting in this pit—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Did he have a chair?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, he was sitting on the ground,
wishing—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I wish I was a bumble bee an’ could
stand on my head like a boy, an’ have all ze
honey I could eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> But while Joseph was in the dark pit,
frightened and crying all alone—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I bet he was afraid of ghosts!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> While he was wondering if his cruel
brothers were going to leave him in the dark
pit, some merchants came along, and Joseph’s
brothers took him out of the pit and
sold him for a slave. Just think of it. Sold
their little brother to be a slave in a country
far away from his home, where he would
have to work hard and where his cruel
master would beat him; where—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> What did zey get for him, Aunt Dora?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Twenty pieces of silver, and now—</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Hump, dat was pitty cheap, but, I spec’
it was all that he was worth.</p>

<p><i>Roy.</i> “But only think, Harry, of the hundreds
and hundreds of books in his father’s
library that he can read as much as he
pleases! Why, if I had them, I’d be the
happiest boy in the State. I wouldn’t waste
a minute. I know just what books I’d read
first—Dickens’ Child’s History of England,
and—”</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> “O yes, Roy, but then he doesn’t
care for books, like you, nor to be a carpenter,
as I mean to be. He wants to be a
farmer, and he says his father don’t mean to
let him—wants Harold to be a banker, like
himself; but those are not the things I was
thinking of when I said I was sorry for him.”</p>

<p><i>Roy.</i> “What was it?”</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> “Why, you know I made a little
bird-house out of that cracker-box mother
gave me; just a common little bird-house,
without any paint or nice things about it,
and set it up on a pole in the garden—”</p>

<p><i>Roy.</i> “Yes, I know, and two families of
blue-birds are living in it. What else?”</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> “Well, Harold begged his father
to let him have a bird-house, and so Mr.
Belmont got a man to make one—oh, a little
beauty!—just like a little Swiss chalet, with
porches and gables, and all painted so nicely,
white with green trimmings and a dark brown
roof, and the pole is striped red, white and
blue, and they put it close to the big maple
tree on the lawn. Oh, it was so nice I was
almost ashamed of my poor little unpainted
house—only the birds were building in it
then, and it made me glad to see them so
busy and happy. Harold was happy, too.
He sat by the window for hours, watching
for the birds to come to his house. But,
Roy, none ever came! They were afraid of
that beautiful house. I guess they thought
it was a trap. Harold don’t sit by the window
to watch it any more; that’s why I’m
sorry for him.”</p>

<p><i>Roy.</i> “Well, that is too bad; but I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
know that we can help him. You couldn’t
give him your little house, because it isn’t
fine enough for his father’s lawn; besides, the
blue-birds might object to moving.”</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> “Of course; but, Roy, don’t you

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Taken care of as you directed, sir.
Mr. Pinchem, I have long—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> What about Bush &amp; Bell’s consignment?</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Received in good order, sir. Mr.
Pinchem, I have long wanted—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> And that shipment to Buffalo?</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> All right, sir. Mr. Pinchem, I have
long wanted to speak to you—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Ah! speak to me? Why, I
thought you spoke to me fifty times a day.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Yes, sir, I know, but this is a
private matter.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Private? Oh! Ah! Wait till I see
how much we made on the last ten thousand
pounds of soap—Six times four are twenty-four;
six times two are twelve and two to
carry make fourteen; six times nought are
nothing and one to carry makes one; six
times five are thirty; seven times four—ah!
well go ahead, I’ll finish this afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Mr. Pinchem, I have been with you
ten long years.—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Ten, eh! Long years, eh! any
longer than any others years? Go ahead.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> And I have always tried to do my
duty.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Have, eh? Go on.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> And I now make bold—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Hold on! What is there bold
about it? But never mind, I’ll hear you out.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Mr. Pinchem I want to ask—ask—I
want to ask—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, why don’t you ask, then? I
don’t see why you don’t ask if you want to.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Mr. Pinchem I want to ask you for—for—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> You want to ask me for the hand
of my daughter. Ah! why didn’t you speak
right out? She’s yours, my boy, take her
and be happy. You might have had her
two years ago if you had mentioned it. Go
along, now, I’m busy. Seven times six are
forty-two, seven times five are thirty-five and
four are thirty-nine, seven times eight—</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Mr. Pinchem—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> What! You here yet? Well,
what is it?</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> I want to ask you for—</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Didn’t I give her to you, you
rascal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Yes, but what I wanted to ask you
for was not the hand of your daughter, but a
raise of salary.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Oh! that was it, eh? Well, sir,
that is an entirely different matter, and it requires
time for serious thought and earnest
deliberation. Return to your work. I’ll
think about it, and some time next fall I’ll
see about giving you a raise of a dollar or so
a week. Seven times eight are fifty-six and
three are fifty-nine—</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="130" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Have you heard any news, neighbor
Search?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Search.</i> News? no. I am
dying to hear some. I have not
heard a word since last night, and it is now
almost noon.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Quick.</i> I have heard a piece of news
as I came along, and you will hardly believe
it, though I received it from a person of veracity,
who was knowing to the fact, and
therefore could not mistake.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Pray let us have it. I hope it is
nothing short of an elopement.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> I hope it is a murder, or, at least,
a suicide. We have not had any news worth
mentioning these two months.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> It is neither an elopement nor a
murder, but you may think it something
akin to the latter. The truth is, there is a
woman down in the village, and they will
not allow her to be buried.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> You don’t say so?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> I do. The coroner has positively
refused to bury her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Do tell! What could the poor
creature have done to be denied Christian
burial?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> I do not know what the offense
was, but they say he has his reasons, and
buried she shall not be.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Where is she lying? I must go
and inquire into it. Bless me, Mrs. Search,
how could this happen and we not hear
of it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Did you hear her name, Mrs.
Quick? That may give us a clue to the mystery.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> I did not learn her name, though,
if I forget not, it began with a G, or some
such letter. But I have a little errand up
the street, and must leave you. In the meantime
as we know so little of the circumstances,
it will be prudent not to repeat
what I have told you. Good morning.
(<i>She goes out</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Did you ever hear anything so
strange? One of two things is certain, she
has either killed herself or been killed, and
is reserved for examination.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> I don’t understand it so. Mrs.
Quick seemed to insinuate that she had been
lying a long time, and was not to be buried
at all. But here comes Mrs. Gossip, and
perhaps she can tell us all about it, as she
comes fresh from the village.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gossip</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Good morning, Mrs. Gossip.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gossip.</i> Good morning, Mrs. Pry.
How do you do, Mrs. Search?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Pretty well, I thank you. How
do you do?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Indifferent, I’m much obliged to
you. I’ve had a touch of hydrophoby, I
believe they call it or something else.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Mrs. Search</span> aside</i>). No new
complaint. She always hated cold water.
(<i>aloud</i>) How did the dreadful disease affect
you, Mrs. G.? What dog bit you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Dog! what do you mean by a
dog? The disease began with a cold in my
head, and a sore throat, and—</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Oh, it was the influenza.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> So it was; I knew it was some
outlandish name, and they all sound alike to
me. For my part, I wish there <i>was</i> no
foreign words.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Mrs. Gossip, did you hear the
particulars of the dreadful news in the village?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> No. What dreadful news? I
have not heard <i>nothing</i>, good, bad, or indifferent.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> What! haven’t you heard of the
woman in the village that they won’t bury?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Not a word. Who is she?
What’s her name?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Her name begins with G, and as
that begins your name, I hoped you would
know something about it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Bless me! I never heard a syllable
of it! Why don’t they bury the poor
thing? I couldn’t refuse to bury even a dog.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> There is a suspicion of murder or
suicide in the case.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Well, they hang murderers and
suicides, don’t they? What can be the matter?
There is something very mysterious
about it!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> I am dying to know all about it.
Come, let’s all go down to the village, and
probe the matter to the bottom. I dearly
love to get hold of a mystery.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> I say, let us all go, and here is
Mrs. Quick coming back. She will go with
us, for she told us the news, and she is dying
to learn the particulars.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. Quick</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Quick.</i> Good morning again, ladies.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Good morning.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> What was the matter with that <i>air</i>
woman that they won’t bury in the village?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> Nothing is the matter with her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Then, in <i>marcy’s</i> name, why don’t
they bury her?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> I know of but one reason, but that
is a very important one.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> We did not know you knew the
reason they wouldn’t bury her. Why did
you not tell us what it was?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> You did not ask me, and, besides,
it is somewhat of a secret.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> You need not fear our disclosing
it. Pray let us have it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Pray do. I am bursting with
curiosity.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> And I too. Mrs. Quick, you say
there is but one reason why they will not
bury the woman, and pray what is that?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Yes, what is it?</p>

<p><i>All</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). What is it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Q.</i> <i>She is not dead!</i></p>

<p class="tb"><i>Farmer Hanks.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Be you the divorce man?</p>

<p><i>Lawyer Porter.</i> (<i>Smiling.</i>) Well,
I don’t exactly know that my vocation
lies particularly in that direction, but
I have been known to undertake such cases.
Are you in trouble?</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> I should rather say so! It’s come
to jest this ’ere climax that I <i>can’t</i> stand it
nohow, not another day; an’ ef you can’t git me
unspliced, I’ll hev to find some one who can.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> What are your grounds for complaint?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span></p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> <i>Grounds!</i> Ordinary grounds
wouldn’t hold ’em! I’ve a hull farm full!</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> One or two are just as efficient in
procuring a divorce as a hundred, providing
the offence is grave enough. Your wife now,
for instance; I suppose she hasn’t fallen in
love with another man?</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Haw-haw! That’s a good ’un!
Betsey in love with <i>another</i> feller! Wal,
hardly, mister! Betsey isn’t no fool. You
can bet high on <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Of course that was a suppositional
case, merely. Is she a scandal-monger?</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Scandal-monger? Not much; ef
ever a woman knew how to hold her tongue
when other folks’s is a-waggin’, that’s Betsey
every time.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Cruel to her children, possibly?</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> I swow, I’ll begin to take you fer
the fool, mister. Our children is growed up
an’ in homes of the’r own, years back; an’
ez fer gran’children, ef ever an old woman
made an idjit of herself over babies, it’s
Betsey with them thar youngsters. She jest
sp’iles them no end, an’ thar’s nobudy they
sets such store by as gran’ma. You hain’t
on the right track, by long odds.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Evidently not. Suppose now, as
my time is valuable, we reverse the case, and
you enlighten me as to the cause of your
unhappiness, instead of my wasting the minutes
in making conjectures? Perhaps incompatibility
of temper may cover the ground.</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> In—com—what kind of temper?
You beat me with them long words o’ yourn;
but, mebbe you’ve struck it, this time. Thar’s
no use talking, but Betsey’s that aggervatin’,
she riles me so it seems like as though I’d
bu’st! Ef she’d ever <i>say</i> a word I could
stand it; but she’s that mum you can’t get a
word out o’ her edgewise; you’d say, for sartain,
thet she’d b’en born deaf, an’ without a
tongue in her mouth.</p>

<p><i>Law. H.</i> A woman and <i>dumb</i>? Ye gods!
This is a reversal of the laws of nature with
a vengeance! Do you mean for me to understand
that your wife <i>never</i> speaks? How
can she conduct her household?</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Oh, she’s chipper enough when
things goes to suit; but when I’m r’iled, an’
dyin’ to see the fur fly—to hev it out with
some one—then she’s mummer than the side
o’ a house; ye couldn’t git a word out o’ her
then with a pair o’ oxen! Ef she’d only spit
it out, too, an’ hev a good out en out settlin’
o’ matters, ’twould clear the air like a thunder-storm;
but thet’s exactly whar the pinch
comes. I might r’are an’ tear, an’ pull the
house down over our heads, fer all the good
’twould do—thet woman would set as calm
es a cucumber, or go about her chores, an’
you’d never guess she knew I was within a
hundred miles o’ her! Either she hain’t got
an atom o’ sense in her git up, or else she’s
too dumb to show it at sech times. It’s
enough to drive a man into fits, an’ I can’t
go it no longer. It’s either her or me that’s
got to git out! I’m willin’ to do my duty to
the letter, an’ give her a share in the old
farm. I wouldn’t see her want for nothin’,
fer in spite o’ her tongue—</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> I rather think you mean her want
of tongue!</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Jest so! There isn’t a kinder or
willin’er woman in the section.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Suppose, now, that we sum up:
your wife, according to your statements, is a
good, pure woman—</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> That she is, lawyer! I’d like to
hear any one say a thing against Betsey’s
character! I’d choke the life out ov him!</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Fond of her children and grandchildren;
don’t gossip; domestic in her tastes—Does
she keep your house in order, your
clothes mended, your wants all attended to,
and give you your meals on time!</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Why, of course! Thet’s what a
wife’s fer, isn’t she? What a question to ax!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span></p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> You acknowledge all this. Now,
supposing, on the contrary, that your wife
was a shrew.</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> (<i>Bewildered.</i>) A which?</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> A cross, scolding woman; a
woman who left her own fireside to gossip
and make scandal among her neighbors; who
neglected her home; who got your meals at
all or no times and let you look out for yourself;
who abused the little children around
her; who—</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Stop, mister! Betsey <i>couldn’t</i> do
none o’ them things. Why, you’d make her
out a pretty sort o’ critter for me to hev been
livin’ with these forty years!</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> No, Betsey couldn’t do all or any
of these things. From your own story you
have a saint instead of an ordinary woman
for a wife; a being who knows that essence of
all true happiness—how to hold her tongue;
who, instead of lowering herself to petty
quarrels and commonplace bickerings, keeps
her temper within bounds while you are purposely
doing all you possibly can to aggravate
her—to make her dislike you—to—</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> (<i>Shamefacedly.</i>) Sho! You air
trying to make out a purty strong case
against me, ain’t you now? I never looked
at it in jest <i>that</i> light before, an’ you can’t tell
how a few words now an’ then would splice
up things in general.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> If your wife were to come to me
and demand a divorce, after what you have
told me, I should be strongly tempted to take
up her case.</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> <i>Betsey</i> git a divorce from <i>me</i>!
Thet’s the best yet! Well, I should as soon
think o’ the sky falling. (<i>Knock at door,
voice outside asking if <span class="smcap">Lawyer Porter</span> is in.</i>)
I’ll be everlastin’ly simmered, ef thet don’t
sound like Betsey’s voice this actual minute!
Whar’ll I go? I don’t want to be found
around these parts; but, what in the name o’
conscience kin <i>she</i> want with you, now?
(<i>Glares, at the lawyer, who takes him by the
shoulder and leads him up to closet door or behind
a screen.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Step into this cover, and be quick
about it. You’ll soon ascertain what your
wife wants of me. And remember, this is a
private interview which you are not to interrupt
(<i><span class="smcap">Farmer Hanks</span> disappears, and the
lawyer goes to door.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs Hanks</span>, hesitatingly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Good morning, madame! What
can I do for you? Let me give you a chair.
(<i>Seats her with back to closet or screen. <span class="smcap">Farmer
H.</span> pokes his head out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> I’ll be durned but it <i>is</i> Betsey!
(<i>Comes half out into room, but <span class="smcap">Lawyer P.</span>
scowls and motions him back. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hanks</span>
sits silent.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> (<i>Kindly.</i>) Well, madame, you
want—</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hanks.</i> (<i>In a half whisper.</i>) I want,
or I <i>guess</i> I want a bill of divorce. (<i><span class="smcap">Farmer
Hanks’s</span> face pops out again, with an expression
of bewilderment and horror upon it.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Your husband is addicted to the
excessive use of liquor, maybe? (<i><span class="smcap">Farmer
H.</span> shakes his fist at the lawyer.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> Good gracious, no! Samuel
never took too much liquor in his life, to my
knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Then, perhaps, he is violent, and
cruel to you and the children?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> Mercy, no! Whatever made you
think of sech a thing! Samuel wouldn’t
hurt a fly; he’s the softest-hearted man in the
world; it isn’t that—it’s only—only—</p>

<p><i>Law.</i> P. Well, you must try to tell me
your difficulty, or I will be unable to help
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> (<i>Bursting into tears.</i>) It’s so hard
to tell, yet it’s so hard to bear. It seems jest
as if I’d go wild ef I had it to stand another
day. Yet except fer this one thing Samuel’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
the best husband a woman could ask fer. He
is perfect temperate in all his habits, liberal
an’ open-handed as the day is long, an’ as
kind an’ considerate as any one could wish
fer. (<i><span class="smcap">Farmer H.</span> looks out at the lawyer exultingly.</i>)
But—but—</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> But what?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh, those <i>dreadful</i> tantrums of
his’n! They come on without any apparent
reason at all, an’ he’s like to a crazy man.</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> And you oppose him and aggravate
him when he gets in these moods, possibly?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> (<i>Sadly.</i>) Oh, no! What good
would <i>that</i> do? or rather, what harm wouldn’t
it do? I jest stand them as best I may, an’
pray the Good Power above for strength to
hold my tongue, an’ bear the affliction which
he has seen fit to visit me with. (<i><span class="smcap">Farmer H.</span>
looks out again with an incredulous, shamefaced
expression, and seems about to speak, but
the lawyer motions him back.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Law. P</i>. And you say absolutely nothing?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> I never hev given way to my
tongue yet; ef I once <i>should</i>, or to the feelin’
that he rouses in me at sech times, I almost
think I should <i>strike</i> him. (<i><span class="smcap">Farmer H.</span> again
advances, but is motioned back.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law. P.</span> Wouldn’t that serve him right?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Strike Samuel? I’d
never forgive myself ef I did. Yet, it is so
hard; you can’t tell! It really seems as ef
the harder I tried to hold my tongue an’ keep
the peace, the worse he got, until sometimes
I ’most think he’d like to <i>kill</i> me!</p>

<p><i>Law. P.</i> Oh, surely not! His wicked temper
would not, or could not, carry itself to
such an extent against such an angel of peace.
But, I cannot find words to express my opinion
of such a brute. I cannot find strong
enough terms to convey my condemnation.
A man who will seek willfully to quarrel with
a wife who is gentleness and meekness itself,
to say nothing of the other cardinal virtues,
is a selfish heartless piece of humanity, unworthy
of the name of man, and deserves
nothing better than the public whipping-post,
which, unhappily—</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> Stop! I will not allow you to
speak of Samuel in such a manner! He may
hev his little faults as all men do—</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> (<i>Rushing out</i>). Yes, let him say
every durned thing he kin of me, Betsey! I
deserve it all, an’ a hundred times more—(<i>Mrs.
Hanks gives a scream and almost sinks
to the floor, but her husband catches her</i>)—when
I think of what a howlin’ idjit I’ve b’en
all these years. The whippin’-post ain’t half
severe enough.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh, you <i>never</i> was that, Samuel!</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> Yes I was, an’ be, up to this very
minute; but I be goin’ to make a clean
breast of it or bu’st. Here I hev b’en thinkin’
an’ sayin’ that you didn’t quarrel with me
nor answer me back, because ye didn’t <i>know</i>
enough—</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh, Samuel, how <i>could</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Far. H.</i> An’ thet you was a perfect fool,
with no spunk in ye, an’ here you’ve b’en
with the spunk all bottled up, an’ never
darin’ to let her loose for fear o’ makin’ <i>me</i>
wuss, an’ doin’ wrong yourself! Oh! I’m
the wickedest kind of a sinner, Betsey.
(<i>Groans</i>). I don’t wonder you want to git a
bill ag’inst me; an’ this here lawyer’ll be
sure to git ye one, as he sees you deserve it
fast enough, an’ I don’t blame neither o’ ye.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. H.</i> But I don’t <i>want</i> it, Samuel. Now
you see jest how it is, an’ that I never allowed
to r’ile you, I’m sure ’twill all be right.
(<i>Turning to Lawyer P</i>). An’ you won’t let
what I’ve said turn you ag’inst him, will you?
You can see for yourself that he never could
hev meant it.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Good morning, madam. Is the head
of the family at home?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Touchwood.</i> Yes, sir, <i>I’m
at home</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Haven’t you a husband?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, sir, but he ain’t the head of
the family, I’d have you to know.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many persons have you in your
family?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Why, bless me, sir, what’s that to
you? You’re mighty inquisitive, I think.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> I’m the man that takes the census.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> If you was a man in your <i>senses</i>
you wouldn’t ask such impertinent questions.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Don’t be offended, old lady, but answer
my questions as I ask them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> “Answer a fool according to his
folly!”—you know what the Scripture says.
<i>Old</i> lady, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Beg your pardon, madam; but I don’t
care about hearing Scripture just at this moment
I’m bound to go according to law and
not according to gospel.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I should think you went neither
according to law nor gospel. What business
is it to you to inquire into folks’ affairs, Mr.
Thingumbob?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> The law makes it my business, good
woman, and if you don’t want to expose
yourself to its penalties, you must answer
my questions.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, it’s the law, is it? That alters
the case. But I should like to know what
the law has to do with other people’s household
matters?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Why, Congress made the law, and if
it don’t please you, you must talk to them
about it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Talk to a fiddle-stick! Why, Congress
is a fool, and you’re another.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Now, good lady, you’re a fine, good-looking
woman; if you’ll give me a few civil
answers I’ll thank you. What I wish to
know first is, how many are there in your
family?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Let me see [<i>counting on her fingers</i>];
there’s I and my husband is one——</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Two, you mean.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Don’t put me out, now, Mr.
Thinkummy. There’s I and my husband is
one——</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Are you always one?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> What’s that to you, I should like
to know. But I tell you, if you don’t leave
off interrupting me I won’t say another word.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Well, take your own way, and be
hanged to you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I will take my own way, and no
thanks to you. [<i>Again counting her fingers.</i>]
There’s I and my husband is one; there’s
John, he’s two; Peter is three, Sue and Moll
are four, and Thomas is five. And then
there’s Mr. Jenkins and his wife and the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
children is six; and there’s Jowler, he’s
seven.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Jowler! Who’s he?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Who’s Jowler! Why, who should
he be but the old house dog?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> It’s the number of persons I want to
know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Very well, Mr. Flippergin, ain’t
Jowler a person? Come here, Jowler, and
speak for yourself. I’m sure he’s as personable
a dog as there is in the whole State.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> He’s a very clever dog, no doubt.
But it’s the number of human beings I want
to know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Human! There ain’t a more human
dog that ever breathed.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Well, but I mean the two-legged kind
of beings.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, the two-legged, is it? Well,
then, there’s the old rooster, he’s seven; the
fighting-cock is eight, and the bantam is
nine——</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Stop, stop, good woman, I don’t want
to know the number of your fowls.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I’m very sorry indeed, I can’t
please you, such a sweet gentleman as you
are. But didn’t you tell me—’twas the two-legged
beings——</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> True, but I didn’t mean the hens.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, now I understand you. The
old gobbler, he’s seven, the hen turkey is
eight; and if you’ll wait a week there’ll be a
parcel of young ones, for the old hen turkey
is setting on a whole snarl of eggs.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Blast your turkeys!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, don’t now, good Mr. Hipper-stitcher,
I pray you don’t. They’re as honest
turkeys as any in the country.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Don’t vex me any more. I’m getting
to be angry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> [<i>striding about the room in a rage</i>.]
Have a care, madam, or I shall fly out of my
skin.</p>

<p><i>Mrs T.</i> If you do, I don’t know who will
fly in.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> You do all you can to anger me. It’s
the two-legged creatures who talk I have reference
to.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, now I understand you. Well
then, our Poll Parrot makes seven and the
black gal eight.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> I see you will have your own way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You have just found out, have
you! You are a smart little man!</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Have you mentioned the whole of
your family?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, that’s the whole—except the
wooden-headed man in front.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Wooden-headed?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, the schoolmaster what’s boarding
here.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> I suppose if he has a wooden head he
lives without eating, and therefore must be
a profitable boarder.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, no, sir, you are mistaken
there. He eats like a leather judgment.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many servants are there in the
family?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Servants! Why, there’s no servants
but me and my husband.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> What makes you and your husband
servants?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I’m a servant to hard work, and
he is a servant to rum. He does nothing all
day but guzzle, guzzle, guzzle; while I’m
working, and stewing, and sweating from
morning till night, and from night till morning.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many colored persons have you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> There’s nobody but Dinah, the
black girl, Poll Parrot and my daughter Sue.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Is your daughter a colored girl?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I guess you’d think so if you was
to see her. She’s always out in the sun—and
she’s tanned up as black as an Indian.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many white males are there in
your family under ten years of age?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Why, there ain’t none now; my
husband don’t carry the mail since he’s taken
to drink so bad. He used to carry two, but
they wasn’t white.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> You mistake, good woman; I meant
male folks, not leather mails.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Let me see; there’s none except
little Thomas, and Mr. Jenkins’ two little
girls.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Males, I said, madam, not females.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Well, if you don’t like them, you
may leave them off.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many white males are there between
ten and twenty?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Why, there’s nobody but John and
Peter, and John ran away last week.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many white males are there between
twenty and thirty?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Let me see—there’s the wooden-headed
man is one, Mr. Jenkins and his wife
is two, and the black girl is three.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> No more of your nonsense, old lady;
I’m heartily tired of it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Hoity toity! Haven’t I a right
to talk as I please in my own house?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> You must answer the questions as I
put them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> “Answer a fool according to his
folly”—you’re right, Mr. Hippogriff.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many white males are there between
thirty and forty?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Why, there’s nobody but I and
my husband—and he was forty-one last
March.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> As you count yourself among the
males, I dare say you wear the breeches.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Well, what if I do, Mr. Impertinence?
Is that anything to you? Mind
your own business, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Certainly—I did but speak. How
many white males are there between forty
and fifty?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> None.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many between fifty and sixty?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> None.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Are there any between this and a
hundred?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> None except the old gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> What old gentleman? You haven’t
mentioned any before.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Why, gramther Grayling—I
thought everybody knew gramther Grayling—he’s
a hundred and two years old next
August, if he lives so long—and I dare say
he will, for he’s got the dry wilt, and they
say such folks never dies.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Now give the number of deaf and
dumb persons.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Why, there is no deaf persons,
excepting husband, and he ain’t so deaf as
he pretends to be. When anybody axes him
to take a drink of rum, if it’s only in a whisper,
he can hear quick enough. But if I
tell him to fetch an armful of wood or feed
the pigs or tend the griddle, he’s as deaf as
a horse-block.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> How many dumb persons?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Dumb! Why, there’s no dumb
body in the house, except the wooden-headed
man, and he never speaks unless he’s spoken
to. To be sure, my husband wishes I was
dumb, but he can’t make it out.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Are there any manufactures carried
on here?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> None to speak on, except turnip
sausages and tow cloth.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Turnip-sausages!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, turnip-sausages. Is there
anything so wonderful in that?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> I never heard of them before. What
kind of machinery is used in making
them?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Nothing but a bread-trough, a
chopping-knife and a sausage filler.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Are they made of clear turnips?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Now you’re terrible inquisitive.
What would you give to know?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> I’ll give you the name of being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
most communicative and pleasant woman
I’ve met with for the last half-hour.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Well, now, you’re a sweet gentleman,
and I must gratify you. You must
know we mix with the turnip a little red
cloth, just enough to give them a color, so
they needn’t look as if they were made of
clear fat meat; then we chop them up well
together, put in a little sage, summer savory,
and black pepper; and they make as pretty
little delicate links as ever was set on a gentleman’s
table; they fetch the highest price
in the market.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Indeed! Have you a piano in the
house?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> A piany! What’s that?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> A musical instrument.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Lor, no. But Sary Jane, down at
the Corners, has one—you see. Sary got all
highfalutin about the great Colushun down
to Bosting, and down she went; an’ when
she came back the old man got no rest until
she had one of the big square music boxes
with white teeth—’spose that’s what you call
a piany.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> You seem to know what it is, then.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, sir. Have you anything
more to ax?</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Nothing more. Good morning, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Stop a moment; can’t you think
of something else? Do now, that’s a good
man. Wouldn’t you like to know what we’re
a-going to have for dinner; or how many
chickens our old white hen hatched at her
last brood; or how many—</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Nothing more—nothing more.</p>

<p>Mrs. T. Here, just look in the cupboard,
and see how many red ants there are in the
sugar-bowl; I haven’t time to count them
myself.</p>

<p><i>Inq.</i> Confound your ants and all your relations.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Good gracious! is that you, Elder
Sniffles! how you <i>did</i> scare me! Never was
so flustrated in all the days o’ my life!
hadn’t the remotest idee o’ meeting <i>you</i> here—would’t
a come for forty dollars if I’d a
s’posed you ever meander’d here. I never
was here afore—but was settin’ by my winder
and I cast my eyes over here, and as I observed
the lofty trees a wavin’ in the gentle
blast, and heerd the feathered songsters a
wobblin’ their mellancolly music, I felt quite
a call to come over; it’s so retired and morantic—such
an approbriate place to marvel
round in, ye know, when a body feels low-sperrited
and unconsolable, as I dew to-night.
O, d-e-a-r!</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Most worthy Mrs. Bedott, your evident
depression fills me with unmitigated
sympathy. Your feelings (if I may be permitted
to judge from the language of your
song, which I overheard)——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> You didn’t though, Elder! the
drefful suz! what <i>shall</i> I dew! I wouldn’t a
had you heerd that song for no money! I
wish I hadn’t a come! I wish to gracious I
hadn’t a come!</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> I assure you, Mrs. Bedott, it was
unintentional on my part, entirely unintentional,
but my contiguity to yourself and
your proximity to me were such as rendered
it impossible for me to avoid hearing
you—</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Well, it can’t be helped now; it’s
no use crying for spilt milk, but I wouldn’t
have you to think I know’d <i>you</i> ever came
here.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> On the contrary, this grove is a
favorite resort of mine; it affords a congenial
retreat after the exterminating and tremendous
mental labors of the day. I not unfrequently
spend the declining hours of the
evening here, buried in the most profound
meditations. On your entrance I was occupying
my customary seat beneath that umbrageous
mounting ash which you perceive
a few feet from you; indeed, had not your
mind been much pre-occupied you could
scarcely have avoided discovering me.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Oh, granf’ther grievous! I wish
I’d staid to hum! I was born for misfortin’
and nothin’ else! I wish to massy I’d staid
to hum to-night! but I felt as if I’d like to
come here once afore I leave the place. [<i>She
weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Ah! indeed! do you project leaving
Scrabble Hill?</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Yes, I dew; I calklate to go next
week. I must hear you preach once more—<i>once</i>
more, Elder, and then I’m gwine—somewhere—I
don’t care where, nor I don’t care
what becomes o’ me when I git there. [<i>She
sobs violently.</i>]</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> O, Mrs. Bedott, you distress me beyond
limitation—permit me to inquire the
cause of this uncontrollable agony?</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> O, Elder Sniffles, you’re the last
indiwidual that ought to ax such a question.
O, I <i>shall</i> die! I shall give it up!</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Madame, my interest in your welfare
is intense; allow me to entreat you still
more vehemently to unburden your mind;
perhaps it is in my power to relieve you.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Relieve me! what an idee! O,
Elder, you <i>will</i> be the death o’ me if you
make me revulge my feelings so. An hour
ago I felt as if I’d a died afore I’d a said what
I hev said now, but you’ve draw’d it out o’
me.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Respected madame, you have as yet
promulgated nothing satisfactory; permit
me——</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> O, granf’ther grievous! must I
come to’t? Well, then, if I must, I must,
so to begin at the beginnin’. When I fust
heern you preach, your sarmons onsettled
my faith; but after a spell I was convinced
by yer argefyin’, and gin up my ’roneus notions,
and my mind got considerably carm.
But how could I set Sabberday after Sabberday
under the droppin’s o’ yer voice, and not
begin to feel a mor’n ordinary interest in the
speaker? I indevored not tew, but I couldn’t
help it; ’twas in vain to struggle against the
feelin’s that prepossest my buzzom. But it’s
all over with me now! my felicitude is at an
end! my sittiwation is hopeless! I shall go
back to Wiggleton next week, and never
truble you no more.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Ah, Mrs. Bedott, you alarm——</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Yes, you never’ll see no more truble
with Prissilly. I’m agwine back to Wiggleton.
Can’t bear to go back thar, nother, on
account o’ the indiwidduals that I come
away to git rid of. There’s Cappen Canoot,
he’s always been after me ever since my husband
died, though I hain’t never gin him no
incurridgement—but he won’t take no for an
answer. I dread the critter’s attentions. And
’Squire Bailey—he’s wonderful rich—but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
ain’t no recommendation to me, and I’ve told
him so time and agin, but I s’pose he thinks
I’ll come round bumby. And Deacon Crosby,
he lost his partner a spell afore I come away;
he was very much pleased with me; he’s a
wonderful fine man—make a fust-rate husband.
I kind o’ hesitated when he promulgated
his sentiments tew me, told him I’d
think on’t till I cum back—s’pose he’ll be at
me as soon as I git there. I hate to disappoint
Deacon Crosby, he’s such a fine man,
and my dezeased companion sot so much by
him, but then I don’t feel for him as I dew
for——. He’s a Presbyterian, tew, and I
don’t think ’twould be right to unite my destination
to hisen.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Undoubtedly in your present state
of feeling, the uncongeniality would render a
union——</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> O, dear, dear, dear! I can’t bear to
go back there and indure their attentions,
but, thank fortune, they won’t bother me long—I
shall go into a decline, I know I shall, as
well as I want to know it. My trubles’ll
soon be over—undoubtedly they’ll put up a
monnyment to my memory—I’ve got the
description all ready for it—it says:</p>

make it convenient to tarry for a short
time at Wiggleton, I assure you it would
afford me much pleasure to visit your grave,
agreeably to your request.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> O, Elder, how onfeelin’!</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Unfeeling! did I not understand you
correctly when I understood you to request
me to visit your grave?</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Yes, but I don’t see how you could
be so carm, when I’m talkin’ about dyin’.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> I assure you, Mrs. Bedott, I had not
the slightest intention of manifesting a want
of feeling in my remark. I should regard
your demise as a most deplorable event, and
it would afford me no small degree of satisfaction
to prevent so melancholy a catastrophe
were it in my power.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Well, I guess I’ll go hum. If Sally
should know you was here a talkin’ with me,
she’d make an awful fuss.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Indeed I see no reason to fear that
my domestic should interfere in any of my
proceedings.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> O, lawful sakes! how numb you
be, elder! I didn’t allude to Sal Blake—I
meant Sal Hugle. She’t you’re ingaged
tew.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Engaged to Miss Hugle! You alarm
me, Mrs. Be——</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Now don’t undertake to deny it,
Elder; everybody says it’s a fact.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Well, then, it only remains for me
to assert that everybody is laboring under an
entire and unmitigated mistake.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> You don’t say so, Elder! Well, I
declare, I do feel relieved. I couldn’t endure
the idea o’ stayin’ here to see that match go
off. She’s so onworthy—so different from
what your companion had ort to be—and
so lazy—and makes such awful poitry; and
then she hain’t worth a cent in the world.
But I don’t want to say a word against her;
for, if you ain’t ingaged now, mabby you
will be. O, Elder! promise me, dew promise
me now’t you won’t marry that critter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
’Twould be a consolation to me when I’m
far away on my dyin’ bed to know—[<i>She
weeps with renewed energy.</i>] O, Elder, I’m
afeared I’m a gwine to have the highsterics.
I’m subjick to spasmotic affections when I’m
excited and overcome.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> You alarm me, Mrs. Bedott! I will
hasten to the house and bring the sal volatile,
which may restore you.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> For the land’s sake, Elder, don’t
go after Sal; she can’t dew nothin’ for me.
It’ll only make talk, for she’ll tell it all round
the village. Jest take that ar newspaper that
sticks out o’ yer pocket, and fan me with it
a leetle. There, I feel quite resusticated.
I’m obliged tew ye; guess I can manage to
get hum now. [<i>She rises.</i>] Farwell, Elder
Sniffles! adoo! we part to meet no more!</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Ah, Mrs. Bedott! do not speak in
that mournful strain; you distress me beyond
all mitigation. [<i>He takes her hand.</i>] Pray
reseat yourself, and allow me to prolong the
conversation for a short period. As I before
observed, your language distresses me beyond
all duration.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Dew you actually feel distressed at
the idee o’ partin’ with me?</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Most indubitably, Mrs. Bedott.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Well, then, what’s the use o’ partin’
at all? O, what have I said? what have I
said?</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Ahem—ahaw, allow me to inquire—are
you in easy circumstances, Mrs.
Bedott?</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Well, not entirely yet, though I
feel considerable easier’n what I did an hour
ago.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Ahem! I imagine that you do not
fully apprehend my meaning. I am a clergyman,
a laborer in the vineyard of the Lord—as
such you will readily understand I cannot be
supposed to abound in the filthy lucre of
this world; my remuneration is small—hence——</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> O, Elder, how can you s’pose I’d
hesitate on account o’ your bein’ poor?
Don’t think on’t—it only increases my opinion
of you; money ain’t no objick to me.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> I naturally infer from your indifference
respecting the amount of <i>my</i> worldly
possessions that you yourself have——</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> Don’t be oneasy, Elder, dear—don’t
illude tew it again; depend on’t you’re
jest as dear tew me, every bit and grain, as
you would be if you owned all the mines in
Ingy.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> I will say no more about it.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> So I s’pose we’re ingaged.</p>

<p><i>E. S.</i> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><i>W. B.</i> We’re ingaged, and my tribbilation
is at an end. [<i>Her head drops on his shoulder.</i>]
O, Shadrack! what will Hugelina say
when she hears on’t?</p>

<p class="dropcap">Oh, Aunt Martha! only hear this! it’s
in the <i>Chronicle</i>. What a splendid
chance! I declare, I’ve a great
mind to answer it myself!</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> What have you got hold of now?
You’re allez a-making some powerful diskivery
somewheres. What now? Something
to turn gray eyes black, and blue eyes
gray?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No; it’s a matrimonial advertisement.
What a splendid fellow this “C. G.”
must be!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Oh, shaw! A body must be
dreadfully put to it, to advertise for a pardner
in the newspapers. Thank goodness! I never
got in such a strait as that ’er. The Lord
has marcyfully kept me thus fur from having
any dealings with the male sect, and I
trust I shall be presarved to the end.</p>

<p><i>Jack Cole.</i> Didn’t you ever have an offer,
Aunt Mattie?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>.) Why, Jack Cole!
What an idee! I’ve had more chances to
change my condition than you’ve got fingers
and toes. But I refused ’em all. A single
life is the only way to be happy. But it did
kinder hurt my feelings to send some of my
sparks adrift—they took it so hard. There
was Colonel Turner. He lost his wife in
June, and the last of August he come over
to our ’ouse, and I gave him to understand
that he needn’t trouble himself; and he felt
so mad that he went rite off and married the
Widder Hopkins afore the month was out.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Poor fellow! How he must have
felt! And, Aunt Mattie, I notice that Deacon
Goodrich looks at you a great deal in meeting,
since you’ve got that pink feather on
your bonnet. What if he should want you
to be a mother to his ten little ones?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>simpering</i>). Law, Jack Cole!
What a dreadful boy you be! (<i>pinches his
ear.</i>) The deacon never thought of such a
thing! But if it should please Providence
to appoint to me such a fate, I should try
and be resigned.</p>

<p><i>Granny Cole.</i> Resigned? Who’s resigned?
Not the President, has he? Well, I don’t
blame him. I’d resign, too, if I was into his
place. Nothing spiles a man’s character so
quick as being President or Congress. Yer
gran’father got in justice of the peace and
chorus, once, and he resigned afore he was
elected. Sed he didn’t want his repetition
spiled.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Three cheers for Gran’father Cole!</p>

<p><i>Granny C.</i> Cheers? What’s the matter
with the cheers, now? Yer father had them
bottomed last year, and this year they were
new painted. What’s to pay with ’em now?</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Do listen, all of you,
to this advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Mary Cole, I’m sorry your head
is so turned with the vanities of this world.
Advertising for a pardner in that way is
wicked. I hadn’t orter listen to it.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh, it won’t hurt you a bit, auntie.
(<i>reads</i>) “A gentleman of about forty, very
fine looking; tall, slender, and fair-haired,
with very expressive eyes, and side whiskers,
and some property, wishes to make the acquaintance
of a young lady with similar
qualifications——”</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> A young lady with expressive eyes
and side whiskers——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Do keep quiet, Jack Cole! (<i>reads</i>)
“With similar qualifications as to good looks
and amiable temper, with a view to matrimony.
Address, with stamp to pay return
postage—C. G., <i>Scrubtown</i>; stating when
and where an interview may be had.” There!
what do you think of that?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Deacon Goodrich to a T. “C. G.”
stands for Calvin Goodrich.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> The land of goodness! Deacon
Goodrich, indeed! a pillar of the church!
advertising for a wife! No, no, Jack; it can’t
be him! He’d never stoop so low!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> But if all the women are as hard-hearted
as you are, and the poor man needs
a wife. Think of his ten little olive plants!</p>

<p><i>Granny C.</i> Plants? Cabbage plants? ’Taint
time to set them out yet. Fust of August is
plenty airly enuff to set ’em for winter. Cabbages
never begin to head till the nights
come cold.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Poor Mr. C. G.! Why don’t you
answer it, Aunt Mattie; and tell him you’ll
darn his stockings for him, and comb that
fair hair of his?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span></p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Jack Cole! if you don’t hold
your tongue, I’ll comb your hair for you in
a way you won’t like. Me answering one
of them low advertisements! <i>Me</i>, indeed!
I hain’t so eager to get married as some folks
I know. Brother Cyrus and I have lived all
our lives in maiden meditation, fancy free—the
only sensible ones of the family of twelve
children; and it’s my idee that we shall continner
on in that way.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Why, don’t you believe that Uncle
Cyrus would get married if he could?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Your Uncle Cyrus! I tell you,
Mary Cole, he wouldn’t marry the best woman
that ever trod! I’ve hearn him say so
a hundred times.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Won’t you answer this advertisement,
auntie? I’ll give you a sheet of my
nicest gilt-edge note-paper if you will!</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> (<i>furiously</i>). If you weren’t so big,
Mary Jane Cole, I’d spank you soundly! I
vow I would! Me answer it, indeed!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Leaves the room in great indignation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Look here, Jack. What’ll you bet
she won’t reply to that notice?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Nonsense! Wouldn’t she blaze if
she could hear you?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I’ll wager my new curled waterfall
against your ruby pin that Aunt Mattie replies
to Mr. “C. G.” before to-morrow night.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Done! I shall wear a curled waterfall
after to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, sir! But I shall wear a ruby
pin. Jack, who do you think “C. G.” is?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Really, I do not know; do you?
Ah! I know you do, by that look in your
eyes. Tell me, that’s a darling.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Not I. I don’t expose secrets to a
fellow who tells them all over town. Besides,
it would spoil the fun.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Mary, you are the dearest little sister
in the world! Tell me, please. (<i>taking her
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, sir! You don’t get that out
of me. Take care, now. Let go of my
hands. I’m going up stairs to keep an eye
on Aunt Mattie. She’s gone up now to
write an answer to “C. G.” And if there is
any fun by-and-by, Jack, if you’re a good boy
you shall be there to see.</p>

<p><i>Granny C.</i> To sea? Going to sea? Why,
Jack Cole! you haint twenty-one yet, and
the sea’s a dreadful place! There’s a sarpint
lives in it as big as the Scrubtown meeting-’us’,
and whales that swaller folks alive,
clothes and all! I read about one in a
book a great while ago that swallered a man
of the name of Jonah, and he didn’t set well
on the critter’s stummuck, and up he come,
lively as ever!</p>

<span class="smcap">Jack</span> cautiously along a shady path.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> There; we’ll squat down behind
this lilac bush. It’s nearly the appointed
hour. I heard Aunt Mattie soliloquizing in
her room this morning, after this manner—“At
eight o’clock this night I go to meet
my destiny! In the deserted garden, under
the old pear tree. How very romantic!”
Hark! there she comes!</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Well, of all the absurd things that
ever I heard tell of! Who would have believed
that our staid old maid aunt would
have been guilty of answering a matrimonial
advertisement?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Hush! Jack, if you make a noise
and spoil the fun now, I’ll never forgive you.
Keep your head still, and don’t fidget so.</p>

<p><i>Aunt Mattie</i> (<i>slowly walking down the
path—soliloquizing</i>.) Eight o’clock! It struck
just as I started out. He ought to be here.
Why does he tarry? If he aint punctual
I’ll give him the mitten. I swow I will!
Dear gracious! what a sitivation to be in!
Me, at my time of life! though, to be shure,
I haint so old as—as I might be. The dew’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
a-falling, and I shall get the rheumatiz in
these thin shoes, if he don’t come quick.
What if Jack and Mary should git hold of
this? I never should hear the last of it!
Never! I wouldn’t have ’em know it for a
thousand dollars! Goodness me! What if
it <i>should</i> be the deacon? Them children of
his’n is dreadful youngsters; but, the Lord
helping me, I’d try to train ’em up in the way
they should go. Hark! is that him a-coming?
No; it’s a toad hopping through the carrot
bed. My soul and body! what if he should
want to kiss me? I’ll chew a clove for fear
he should. I wonder if it would be properous
to let him? But then I s’pose if it’s the
deacon I couldn’t help myself. He’s an awful
<i>dee</i>tarmined man; and if I couldn’t help it
I shouldn’t be to blame! Deary me! how I
trimble! There he comes! I hear his step!
What a tall man! ’Taint the deacon. He’s
got a shawl on! Must be the new school-master!
he wears a shawl! (<i>a man approaches,

<p><i>C. G.</i> Yes, it is; Is this Miss M. G.?</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> It is. Dear sir, I hope you wont

<p><i>C. G.</i> Never! Ah, the happiness of this

proper out here in this old garden! It’s
a dreadful lonely spot, and if people should
see us they might talk.</p>

<p><i>C. G.</i> Let ’em talk! They’ll talk still
more when you and I are married, I reckon.
Lift your veil and let me see your sweet face.</p>

<p><i>Aunt M.</i> Yes, if you’ll remove that hat
and let me behold your countenance.</p>

<p><i>C. G.</i> Now, then; both together. (<i><span class="smcap">Aunt

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-y.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Your being Sir Anthony’s son, Captain,
would itself be a sufficient accommodation;
but from the ingenuity of
your appearance, I am convinced you deserve
the character here given of you.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> Permit me to say, madame, that
as I have never yet had the pleasure of seeing
Miss Languish, my principal inducement
in this affair, at present, is the honor of being
allied to Mrs. Malaprop, of whose intellectual
accomplishments, elegant manners and unaffected
learning no tongue is silent.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Sir, you do me infinite honor!
I beg, Captain, you’ll be seated. [<i>Both sit.</i>]
Ah! few gentlemen, nowadays, know how to
value the ineffectual qualities in a woman!
Men have no sense now but for the worthless
flower of beauty.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> It is but too true, indeed, ma’am;
yet I fear our ladies should share the blame;
they think our admiration of beauty so
great that knowledge in them would be
superfluous. Thus, like garden trees, they
seldom show fruit till time has robbed them
of the more spacious blossoms: few, like
Mrs. Malaprop and the orange tree, are rich
in both at once.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Sir, you overpower me with good
breeding. [<i>Aside.</i>] He is the very pineapple
of politeness! You are not ignorant,
Captain, that this giddy girl has, somehow,
contrived to fix her affections on a beggarly,
strolling, eavesdropping ensign, whom none
of us have seen, and nobody knows anything
of.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> Oh, I have heard the silly affair
before. I’m not at all prejudiced against her
on that account. But it must be very distressing,
indeed, to you, ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Oh, it gives me the hydrostatics
to such a degree!—I thought she had persisted
from corresponding with him; but,
behold, this very day, I have interceded
another letter from the fellow—I believe I
have it in my pocket.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> My last note! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Ay, here it is.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> Oh, the little traitress, Lucy!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> There, perhaps you may know
the writing. [<i>Gives him the letter.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> I think I have seen the hand
before—yes, I certainly must have seen this
hand before.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Nay, but read it, Captain.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> [<i>reads</i>.] “My soul’s idol, my
adored Lydia!” Very tender, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Tender! ay, and profane too,
o’my conscience.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> “I am excessively alarmed at the
intelligence you send me, the more so as my
new rival”——</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> That’s you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> “Has universally the character of
being an accomplished gentleman and a man
of honor.” Well, that’s handsome enough.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Oh, the fellow has some design
in writing so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span></p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> That he had, I’ll answer for him,
ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> But go on, sir—you’ll see presently.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> “As for the old weather-beaten
she-dragon who guards you”?—who can he
mean by that?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Me, sir—me—he means me there—what
do you think now?—but go on a
little further.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> Impudent scoundrel!—“it shall
go hard, but I will elude her vigilance! as I
am told that the same ridiculous vanity which
makes her dress up her coarse features and
deck her dull chat with hard words which
she don’t understand”——</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> There, sir, an attack upon my
language! what do you think of that?—an
aspersion upon my parts of speech! was ever
such a brute! Sure, if I reprehend anything
in this world, it is the use of my oracular
tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> He deserves to be hanged and
quartered! let me see—“same ridiculous
vanity”——</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> You need not read it again, sir!</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> I beg pardon, ma’am—“does also
lay her open to the grossest deceptions from
flattery and pretended admiration”—an impudent
coxcomb—“so that I have a scheme
to see you shortly, with the old harridan’s
consent, and even to make her a go-between
in our interviews”—Was ever such assurance!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Did you ever hear anything like
it? [<i>They rise.</i>] He’ll elude my vigilance,
will he?—yes, yes!—ha! ha! he’s very likely
to enter these doors!—we’ll try who can run
best!</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> So we will, ma’am—so we will—Ha!
ha! ha! a conceited puppy! ha! ha!
ha!—Well, but Mrs. Malaprop, as the girl
seems so infatuated by this fellow, suppose
you were to wink at her corresponding with
him for a little time—let her even plot an
elopement with him—then do you connive
at her escape—while I, just in the nick, will
have the fellow laid by the heels, and fairly
contrive to carry her off in his stead.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I am delighted with the scheme;
never was anything better perpetrated.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> But, pray, could I not see the
lady for a few minutes now?—I should like
to try her temper a little.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Why, I don’t know—I doubt she
is not prepared for a visit of this kind.
There is a decorum in these matters.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> O, she won’t mind me!—only
tell her Beverley——</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Sir!</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> Gently, good tongue! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> What did you say of Beverley?</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> Oh, I was going to propose that
you should tell her, by way of jest, that it
was Beverley who was below—she’d come
down fast enough then—ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> ’Twould be a trick she well deserves—besides,
you know, the fellow tells
her he’ll get my consent to see her—ha! ha!—Let
him, if he can, I say again.—Lydia,
come down here! [<i>Calling.</i>] He’ll make
me a go-between in their interviews!—ha!
ha! ha!—Come down, I say, Lydia!—I
don’t wonder at your laughing—ha! ha! ha!
his impudence is truly ridiculous.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> ’Tis very ridiculous, upon my
soul, ma’am!—ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> The little hussy won’t hear. Well,
I’ll go and tell her at once who it is—she
shall know that Captain Absolute is come
to wait on her; and I’ll make her behave as
becomes a young woman.</p>

<p><i>Capt. A.</i> As you please ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> For the present, Captain, your
servant—Ah! you’ve not done laughing
yet, I see—elude my vigilance! yes, yes—Ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Good evenin’ to you, ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Good evenin’ to you, Mr. Costello.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> It’s fine weather we’re havin’, ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> It is that, thank God, but the winter’s
comin’ at last, and it comes to all, both
great and small.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah! but for all that it doesn’t come
to all alike. Nowhere are you, ma’am, fat, rosy
and good-lookin’, equally swate as a summer
greenin’, a fall pippin or a winter russet—</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Arrah, hould your whist, now.
Much an old bachelor like you knows about
apples or women. But come in, Mr. Costello,
and take a cup o’ tay with me, for I was
only standin’ be the door lookin’ at the people
passin’ for company sake, like, and I’m
sure the kittle must have sung itself hoarse.
[<i><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> enters and sits.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> It’s very cosy ye are here, Mrs.
Cummiskey.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Yes. [<i>Lays the supper.</i>] It is that
whin I do be havin’ company.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah! it must be lonesome for you
with only yer cat and the cup o’ tay.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Sure it is. But sit up to the table,
Mr. Costello. Help yourself to this fish, and
don’t furget the purtaties. Look at them;
they’re splittin’ their sides wid laughin’. [<i>She
pours tea.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I’m sensible of the comforts of a
home, Mrs. Cummiskey, though I’ve none
meself. Mind now, the difference between
the taste o’ tay made and sarved that way
and the tay they gives you in an aitin’-house.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Sure there’s nothin’ like a little
home of yer own. I wonder yer never got
marrit, Mr. Costello.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I was about to make the same remark
in rifference to yerself, ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> God help us, aren’t I a widder
woman this seven years?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah, but it’s thinkin’ I was why ye
didn’t get marrit again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Well, it’s sure I am [<i>thoughtfully
setting down her teacup and raising her hand
by way of emphasis</i>], there was no betther
husband to any woman than him that’s dead
and gone, heaven save an’ rest his sowl. He
was that asy a child could do anything wid
him, and he was as humorous as a monkey.
You favor him very much, Mr. Costello.
He was about your height, and complicted
like you.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> He often used to say to me in his
banterin’ way, Sure, Nora, what’s the woruld
to a man whin his wife is a widder, manin’,
you know, that all the timptations and luxuries
of this life can never folly a man beyant
the grave. Sure, Nora, says he, what’s the
woruld to a man whin his wife’s a widder?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> It was a sensible sayin’ that [<i>helping
himself to more fish</i>].</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I mind the day John died. He
knew everything to the last, and about four
o’clock in the afthernoon—it was seventeen
minutes past five exactly, be the clock, that
he died—he says to me, Nora, says he, you’ve
been a good wife, says he, an’ I’ve been a
good husband, says he, an’ so there’s no love
lost atween us, says he, an’ I could give ye a
good characthur to any place, says he, an’ I
wish ye could do the same for me where I’m
goin’, says he; but it’s case equal, says he,
an’ every dog has his day, an’ some has a day
an’ a half, says he, an’ says he, I’ll know more
in a bit than Father Corrigan himself, says
he, but I’ll say now, says he, that I’ve always
been a true son of the Church, says he, so
I’ll not bother my brains about it; an’ he
says, says he, I lave ye in good hands, Nora<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
for I lave you in your hands, says he; an’ if
at any time ye see any wan ye like betther
nor me, marry him, says he. Ah, Nora, says
he, for the first time spakin’ it solemn like,
ah, Nora, what’s the woruld to a man whin
his wife’s a widder? An’ says he, I lave fifty
dollars for masses, and the rest I lave to yourself,
said he, an’ I needn’t tell ye to be a good
mother to the childer’, says he, for well ye
know there are none. Ah, poor John! Will
ye have another cup of tay, Mr. Costello?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> It must have been very hard on
ye [<i>passing cup</i>]. Thank ye, ma’am, no
more.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> It was hard, but time will tell. I
must cast about me for my own livin’; and
so I got intil this place an’ here I am to-day.
[<i>Both rise from the table and seat themselves
before the fire.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah! an’ here we are both of us
this evenin.’</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Here we are, sure enough.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> And so I mind ye of—of him, do I?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> That ye do. Ye favor him greatly.
Dark complicted, an’ the same plisint smile.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Now, with me sittin’ here an’ you
sittin’ there ferninst me, ye might almost
think ye were marrit agin. [<i>Insinuatingly.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Ah, go away now for a taze that
ye are. [<i>Mussing her apron by rolling the
corners of it.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I disremember what it was ye said
about seein’ any man you liked betther nor
him. [<i>Moving his chair nearer to that of the
widow.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> He said, said he [<i>smoothing her
apron over her knees</i>], Nora, said he, if anny
time ye see anny man ye like betther nor me,
marry him, says he.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Did he say anything about anny
one ye liked as good as him?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I don’t mind that he did. [<i>Reflectively,
folding her hands in her lap.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I suppose he left that to yerself?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Faith, an’ I don’t know, thin.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Div ye think ye like me as well as
ye did him? [<i>Persuasively, leaning forward
to look into the widow’s eyes, which are cast
down.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Ah, go away now for a taze.
[<i>Straightening herself and playfully slapping
<span class="smcap">Mr. Costello</span> on the face. He moves his
chair still nearer, and puts his arm around
her waist.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Tell me, div ye like me as well as
ye did him?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I—I most—I most disremember
now how much I liked him. [<i>Embarrassed.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah, now, don’t be breakin’ me
heart. Answer me this question, Mrs. Cummiskey—Is
your heart tender toward me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> It is [<i>whispers</i>], an’ there, now ye
have it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Glory! [<i>Kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> But, James, ye haven’t told me yet
how ye liked yer tay?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Ah, Nora, me jewel, the taste of
that first kiss would take away the taste of
all the tay that ever was brewed.</p>

left leg, the knee of which is bowed outward,
hoe on his shoulder.</i></p>

<p><i>Uncle Pete.</i> (<i>Pausing as he enters, shading
his eyes with his hand, going towards
<span class="smcap">George Peyton</span>.</i>) Yes, dar he is; dar is
Marse George, a sittin’ on the porch, a
readin’ his papah. Golly, I cotch him at
home! (<i>Advancing and calling</i>) Marse
George, Marse George, I’s come to see you
once mo’, once mo,’ befo’ I leabes you fo’ebber.
Marse George, I’se gwine to de odder
shoah; I’se far on de way to my long home,
to dat home ober acrost de ribber, whar de
wicked hab’ no mo’ trouble, and where water-millions
ripen all the year! Youns has all
bin berry kine to me heah, Marse George,
berry kine to de ole man, but I’s gwine
away, acrost de dark ribber. I’s gwine ober,
an’ dar, on dat odder shoah, I’ll stan’ an’
pick on de golden hawp among de angels,
an’ in de company of de blest. Dar I’ll fine
my rest; dar I’ll stan’ befo’ de throne fo’
ebber mo’ a singin’ an’ a shoutin’ susannis to
de Lord!</p>

<p><i>George Peyton.</i> Oh, no, Uncle Pete, you’re
all right yet—you’re good for another twenty
years.</p>

<p><i>Uncle P.</i> Berry kine o’ you to say dat,
Marse George—berry kine—but it’s no use.
It almos’ breaks my hawt to leab you, and to
leab de missus and de chillun, Marse George,
but I’s got my call—I’s all gone inside.</p>

<p><i>George P.</i> Don’t talk so, Uncle Pete; you
are still quite a hale old man.</p>

<p><i>Uncle P.</i> No use talkin’, Marse George, I’s
gwine to hebben berry soon. ’Pears like I
can heah the singin’ on de odder shoah.
’Pears like I can heah de voice of ol’ “Aunt
Liza” an’ de odders dat’s gone befoah.
You’s bin berry kine, Marse George—de
missus an’ de chillun’s bin berry good—seems
like all de people’s been berry good to poor
ole Pete—poor cretur like me.</p>

<p><i>George P.</i> Nonsense, Uncle Pete (<i>kindly
and encouragingly</i>), nonsense, you are good
for many years yet. You’ll see the sod
placed on the graves of many younger men
than you are, before they dig the hole for
you. What you want just now, Uncle Pete,
is a good square meal. Go into the kitchen
and help yourself—fill up inside. There is
no one at home, but I think you know the
road. Plenty of cold victuals of all kinds in
there.</p>

stay, I’ll not go agin natur’; but it’s no use.
I’s all gone inside—I’s got my call. I’m one o’
dem dat’s on de way to de golden shoah.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Uncle Pete</span> through door, his limp
hardly noticeable. His manner showing his delight.</i>)</p>

<p><i>George P.</i> Poor old Uncle Pete, he seems to
be the victim of religious enthusiasm. I suppose
he has been to camp-meeting, but he is a
cunning old fox, and it must have taken a
regular hard-shell sermon to convert the old
sinner. He was raised on this plantation, and
I have often heard my father say, he hadn’t a
better negro on the place. Ever since the war,
he has been working a little, and loafing a good
deal, and I have no doubt he sometimes sighs to
be a slave again at work on the old plantation.

<h3>THE DUEL.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sir Lucius O’Trigger</span> to left, with pistols,
followed by <span class="smcap">Acres</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Acres.</i> (<i>L.</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) By my valor, then, Sir Lucius,
forty yards is a good distance. Odds levels and
aims!—I say it is a good distance.</p>

<p><i>Sir Lucius.</i> (<i>R.</i>) Is it for muskets or small
field-pieces? Upon my conscience Mr. Acres,
you must leave those things to me.—Stay, now—I’ll
show you. (<i>Measures paces along the floor.</i>)
There, now, that is a very pretty distance—a
pretty gentleman’s distance.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> (<i>R.</i>) Zounds! we might as well fight
in a sentry-box! I tell you, Sir Lucius, the
further he is off, the cooler I shall take my aim.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> (<i>L.</i>) Faith! then I suppose you would
aim at him best of all if he was out of sight!</p>

<p>Acr. No, Sir Lucius; but I should think
forty or eight-and-thirty yards—</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Pooh! pooh! nonsense! Three or
four feet between the mouths of your pistols is
as good as a mile.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Odds bullets, no!—by my valor! here
is no merit in killing him so near! Do, my
dear Sir Lucius, let me bring him down at a long
shot:—a long shot, Sir Lucius, if you love me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Well, the gentlemen’s friend and I
must settle that. But tell me now, Mr. Acres,
in case of an accident, is there any little will or
commission I could execute for you?</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> I am much obliged to you, Sir Lucius—but
I don’t understand—</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Why, you may think there’s no being
shot at without a little risk; and if an unlucky
bullet should carry a quietus with it—I say it
will be no time then to be bothering you about
family matters.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> A quietus!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> For instance, now—if that should be
the case—would you choose to be pickled and
sent home?—or would it be the same to you to
lie here in the Abbey?—I’m told there is
very snug lying in the Abbey.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Pickled!—Snugly in the Abbey!—Odds
tremors! Sir Lucius, don’t talk so!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> I suppose, Mr. Acres, you never were
engaged in an affair of this kind before.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> No, Sir Lucius, never before.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Ah! that’s a pity!—there’s nothing
like being used to a thing. Pray, now, how
would you receive the gentlemen’s shot?</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Odds files!—I’ve practiced that—there,
Sir Lucius—there. (<i>Puts himself in an attitude.</i>)
A side front, hey? I’ll make myself
small enough: I’ll stand edgeways.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Now—you’re quite out—for if you
stand so when I take my aim—(<i>Leveling at
him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Zounds! Sir Lucius—are you sure it is
not cocked?</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Never fear.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> But—but—you don’t know—it may go
off of its own head!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Pooh! be easy. Well, now, if I hit
you in the body, my bullet has a double chance;
for, if it misses a vital part of your right side,
’twill be very hard if it don’t succeed on the
left.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> A vital part!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> But, there, fix yourself so—(<i>placing
him</i>)—let him see the broadside of your full
front, there, now, a ball or two may pass clean
through your body, and never do any harm at
all.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Clean through me!—a ball or two clean
through me!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Ay, may they; and it is much the
genteelest attitude into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Look’ee, Sir Lucius! I’d just as lieve
be shot in an awkward posture as a genteel one;
so, by my valor! I will stand edgeways.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> (<i>Looking at his watch.</i>) Sure, they don’t
mean to disappoint us. Ha! no, faith; I think
I see them coming. (<i>Crosses to R.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> (<i>L.</i>) Hey!—what!—coming!—</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Ay. Who are those yonder, getting
over the stile?</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> There are two of them, indeed! Well—let
them come—hey, Sir Lucius! we—we—we—we—won’t
run!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Run!</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> No,—I say,—we won’t run, by my
valor!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> What’s the matter with you?</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Nothing—nothing—my dear friend—my
dear Sir Lucius! but I—I don’t feel quite
so bold, somehow, as I did.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> O, fy! Consider your honor.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Ay—true—my honor. Do, Sir Lucius,
edge in a word or two every now and then about
my honor.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Well, here they’re coming. (<i>Looking
R.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Sir Lucius, if I wa’n’t with you, I should
almost think I was afraid! If my valor should
leave me!—Valor will come and go.</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Then pray keep it fast while you
have it.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> Sir Lucius, I doubt it is going!—yes—my
valor is certainly going!—it is sneaking off!
I feel it oozing out, as it were, at the palms of
my hands!</p>

<p><i>Sir L.</i> Your honor! your honor! Here they
are.</p>

<p><i>Acr.</i> O mercy!—now—that I was safe at
Clod Hall! or could be shot before I was aware!

him reluctantly off, R.</i>)</p>

<h3>READING THE WILL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i><span class="smcap">Swipes</span>, a brewer. <span class="smcap">Currie</span>, a saddler.
<span class="smcap">Frank Millington</span>, and <span class="smcap">’Squire Drawl</span>.</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Swipes</span>, R.,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <span class="smcap">Currie</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> A sober occasion this, brother Currie!
Who would have thought the old lady was so
near her end?</p>

<p><i>Currie.</i> Ah! we must all die, brother Swipes.
Those who live longest outlive the most.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> True, true; but, since we must die
and leave our earthly possessions, it is well that
the law takes such good care of us. Had the old
lady her senses when she departed?</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> Perfectly, perfectly. ’Squire Drawl told
me she read every word of her last will and testament
aloud, and never signed her name better.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> Had you any hint from the ’Squire
what disposition she made of her property?</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> Not a whisper! the ’Squire is as close
as a miser’s purse. But one of the witnesses
hinted to me that she has cut off her graceless
nephew with a shilling.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> Has she? Good soul! Has she?
You know I come in, then, in right of my wife.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> And I in my <i>own</i> right; and this is, no
doubt, the reason why we have been called to
hear the reading of the will. ’Squire Drawl
knows how things should be done, though he is
as air-tight as one of your own beer-barrels,
brother Swipes. But here comes the young reprobate.
He must be present, as a matter of
course, you know. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Frank Millington</span>,
R.</i>) Your servant, young gentleman. So, your
benefactress has left you, at last!</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> It is a painful thing to part with old
and good friends, Mr. Millington.</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> It is so, sir; but I could bear her loss
better, had I not so often been ungrateful for her
kindness. She was my only friend, and I knew
not her value.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> It is too late to repent, Master Millington.
You will now have a chance to earn your
own bread.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> Ay, ay, by the sweat of your brow,
as better people are obliged to. You would
make a fine brewer’s boy, if you were not too
old.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> Ay, or a saddler’s lackey, if held with
a tight rein.</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> Gentlemen, your remarks imply that
my aunt has treated me as I deserved. I am
above your insults, and only hope you will
bear your fortune as modestly, as I shall mine
submissively. I shall retire. (<i>As he is going,
R., enter <span class="smcap">’Squire Drawl</span>, R.</i>)</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> Stop, stop, young man! We must
have your presence. Good-morning, gentlemen:
you are early on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> I hope the ’Squire is well to-day.</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> Pretty comfortable for an invalid.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> I trust the damp air has not affected
your lungs.</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> No, I believe not. You know I
never hurry. <i>Slow and sure</i> is my maxim.
Well, since the heirs-at-law are all convened, I
shall proceed to open the last will and testament
of your deceased relative, according to law.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> (<i>While the <span class="smcap">’Squire</span> is breaking the
seal.</i>) It is a trying scene to leave all one’s
possessions, ’Squire, in this manner!</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> It really makes me feel melancholy
when I look round and see everything but the
venerable owner of these goods. Well did the
preacher say, All is vanity!</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> Please to be seated, gentlemen.</p>

<p>(<i>All sit.—The <span class="smcap">’Squire</span> puts on his spectacles,
and reads slowly.</i>) “Imprimis: Whereas my
nephew, Francis Millington, by his disobedience
and ungrateful conduct, has shown himself unworthy
of my bounty, and incapable of managing
my large estate, I do hereby give and bequeath
all my houses, farms, stocks, bonds,
moneys and property, both personal and real, to
my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of Malt street,
brewer, and Christopher Currie, of Fly Court,
saddler.” (<i><span class="smcap">’Squire</span> takes off his spectacles to
wipe them.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> (<i>Dreadfully overcome.</i>) Generous
creature! kind soul! I always loved her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span></p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> She <i>was</i> good, she <i>was</i> kind! She was
in her right mind. Brother Swipes, when we
divide, I think I will take the mansion-house.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> Not so fast, if you please, Mr. Currie!
My wife has long had her eye upon that,
and must have it. (<i>Both rise.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> There will be two words to that bargain,
Mr. Swipes! And, besides, I ought to
have the first choice. Did not I lend her a new
chaise every time she wished to ride? And who
knows what influence——.</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> Am I not named first in her will?
And did I not furnish her with my best small
beer for more than six months? And who
knows——.</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> Gentlemen, I must leave you.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> (<i>Wiping his spectacles, and putting
them on.</i>) Pray, gentlemen, keep your seats. I
have not done yet. (<i>All sit.</i>) Let me see;
where was I?—Ay,—“All my property, both
personal and real, to my dear cousins, Samuel
Swipes, of Malt street, brewer——”</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> Yes!</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> “And Christopher Currie, Fly Court,
saddler——”</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> Yes!</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> “To have and to hold in trust, for
the sole and exclusive benefit of my nephew,
Francis Millington, until he shall have attained
the age of twenty-one years; by which time I
hope he will have so far reformed his evil habits,
as that he may safely be intrusted with the large
fortune which I hereby bequeath to him.”</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> What’s all this? You don’t mean
that we are humbugged? <i>In trust!</i>—how does
that appear? Where is it?</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> (<i>Pointing to the parchment.</i>) There!
In two words of as good old English as I ever
penned.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> Pretty well, too, Mr. ’Squire, if we
must be sent for to be made a laughing-stock of!
She shall pay for every ride she had out of my
chaise, I promise you!</p>

<p><i>Swipes.</i> And for every drop of my beer.
Fine times, if two sober, hard-working citizens
are to be brought here to be made the sport of a
graceless profligate! But we will manage his
property for him, Mr. Currie! We will make
him feel that trustees are not to be trifled with!</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> That will we!</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> Not so fast, gentlemen; for the
instrument is dated three years ago, and the
young gentleman must already be of age, and
able to take care of himself. Is it not so,
Francis?</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> It is, your worship.</p>

<p><i>’Squire.</i> Then, gentlemen, having attended to
the breaking of this seal according to law, you
are released from any further trouble in the
premises.</p>

<p><i>Remnant.</i> Well, I am resolved I’ll collect my
bill of Col. Blarney this time. He shan’t put
me off again. This is the twentieth time, as
I’m a sinner, that I have dunned him! His
smooth words shan’t humbug me now. No,
no! Richard Remnant is not such a goose as
to be paid in fine words for fine clothes. (<i>Takes
out a long bill and unrolls it.</i>) A pretty collection
of items, that! Why, the interest alone
would make a good round sum. But hark!
He is coming. (<i>Hastily rolls up the bill and
returns it to his pocket.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Col. Blarney</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><i>Blarney.</i> Ah! my dear Remnant, a thousand
welcomes! How delighted I am to see you!
And what stupidity on the part of my people not
to make you enter at once! True, I had given
orders that they should admit nobody; but those
orders did not extend to you, my dear sir, for
to you I am always at home.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Much obliged, sir. (<i>Fumbling in his
pocket for his bill.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> (<i>calling to his servants</i>.) What, ho!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
John! Martha! confound you! I will teach
you to keep my friend Remnant kicking his
heels in the entry! I will teach you to distinguish
among my visitors!</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Indeed, sir, it is no sort of consequence.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> But it <i>is</i> consequence! To tell you—you,
one of my best friends—that I was not in!</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> I am your humble servant, sir. (<i>Drawing forth
bill.</i>) I just dropped in to hand you
this little—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Quick, there, quick! A chair for my
friend Remnant!</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> I am very well as I am, sir.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Not at all! I would have you seated.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> It is not necessary. (<i>Servant hands a
common chair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Rascal!—not that! An arm-chair!</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> You are taking too much trouble. (<i>An
arm-chair is placed for him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> No, no; you have been walking some
distance, and require rest. Now be seated.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> There is no need of it—I have but a
single word to say. I have brought—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Be seated, I say. I will not listen to
you till you are seated.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Well, sir, I will do as you wish. (<i>Sits.</i>)
I was about to say—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Upon my word, friend Remnant, you
are looking remarkably well.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Yes, sir, thank heaven, I am pretty
well. I have come with this—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> You have an admirable stock of health—lips
fresh, skin ruddy, eyes clear and bright—really—</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> If you would be good enough to—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> And how is Madam Remnant?</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Quite well, sir, I am happy to say.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> A charming woman, Mr. Remnant! A
very superior woman.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> She will be much obliged, sir. As I
was saying—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> And your daughter, Claudine, how is
she?</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> As well as can be.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> The beautiful little thing that she is!
I am quite in love with her.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> You do us too much honor, sir. I—you—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> And little Harry—does he make as
much noise as ever, beating that drum of his?</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Ah, yes! He goes on the same as ever.
But, as I was saying—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> And your little dog, Brisk,—does he
bark as loud as ever, and snap at the legs of
your visitors?</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> More than ever, sir, and we don’t know
how to cure him. He, he! But I dropped in
to—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Do not be surprised if I want particular
news of all your family, for I take the
deepest interest in all of you.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> We are much obliged to your honor,
much obliged. I—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> (<i>Giving his hand.</i>) Your hand upon it,
Mr. Remnant. Don’t rise. Now, tell me, do
you stand well with the people of quality?—for
I can make interest for you among them.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Sir, I am your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> And I am yours, with all my heart.
(<i>Shaking hands again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> You do me too much honor.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> There is nothing I would not do for you.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Sir, you are too kind to me.</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> At least I am disinterested; be sure of
that, Mr. Remnant.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Certainly I have not merited these
favors, sir. But, sir,—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Now I think of it, will you stay and sup
with me?—without ceremony, of course.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> No, sir, I must return to my shop; I
should have been there before this. I—</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> What ho, there! A light for Mr. Remnant!
and tell the coachman to bring the coach
and drive him home.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Indeed, sir, it is not necessary. I can
walk well enough. But here— (<i>Offering bill.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> O! I shall not listen to it. Walk?
Such a night as this! I am your friend, Remnant,
and, what is more, your debtor—your
debtor, I say—all the world may know it.</p>

<p><i>Rem.</i> Ah! sir if you could but find it convenient—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span></p>

<p><i>Blar.</i> Hark! There is the coach. One more
embrace, my dear Remnant! (<i>Shakes hands
again.</i>) Take care of the steps. Command
me always; and be sure there is nothing in
the world I would not do for you. There!
Good-by.</p>

in,” as he calls it, from house to house at the
most unreasonable times, to the annoyance of
every family in the village. But I’ll soon get
rid of him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Pry</span>, L., with umbrella, which he places
against the wall.</i></p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Ha! how d’ye do, Mr. Doubledot?</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Very busy, Mr. Pry, and have scarcely
time to say, “Pretty well, thank ye.” (<i>Turns
from him as if writing in memorandum book.
<span class="smcap">Simon</span> advances.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Ha, Simon! you here? Rather early
in the morning to be in a public house. Been
taking a horn, eh? Sent here with a message
from your master, perhaps? I say, Simon,
when this wedding takes place, I suppose your
master will put you all into new liveries, eh?</p>

<p><i>Simon.</i> Can’t say, sir.</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Well, I think he might. (<i>Touches
<span class="smcap">Simon’s</span> sleeve.</i>) Between ourselves, Simon,
it won’t be before you want ’em, eh?</p>

<p><i>Simon.</i> That’s master’s business, sir, and
neither yours nor mine.</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Mr. Simon, behave yourself, or I shall
complain of you to the colonel. By the way,
Simon, that’s an uncommon fine leg of mutton
the butcher has sent to your house. It weighs
thirteen pounds five ounces.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> And how do you know that?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> I asked the butcher. I say, Simon, is
it for roasting or boiling?</p>

<p><i>Simon.</i> Half and half, with the chill taken
off. There’s your answer.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Simon</span>, R.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> That’s an uncommon ill-behaved servant!
Well, since you say you are busy, I
won’t interrupt you; only, as I was passing, I
thought I might as well drop in.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Then you may now drop out again.
The railway ’bus will be in presently, and—</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> No passengers by it to-day, for I have
been to the hill to look for it.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Did you expect any one by it, that
you were so anxious?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> No; but I make it my business to see
the coach come in every day. I can’t bear to
be idle.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Useful occupation, truly!</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Always see it go out; have done so
these ten years.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> (<i>Going up.</i>) Tiresome blockhead!
Well; good morning to you.</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Good-morning, Mr. Doubledot. Your
tavern doesn’t appear to be very full just now.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> No, no.</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Ha! you are at a heavy rent? (<i>Pauses
for an answer after each question.</i>) I’ve often
thought of that. No supporting such an establishment
without a deal of custom. If it’s not
an impertinent question, don’t you find it rather
a hard matter to make both ends meet when
the first of the month comes round?</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> If it isn’t asking an impertinent question,
what’s that to you?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> O, nothing; only some folks have the
luck of it: they have just taken in a nobleman’s
family at the opposition house, the Green
Dragon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span></p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> What’s that? A nobleman at the
Green Dragon!</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Traveling carriage and four. Three
servants on the dickey and an outrider, all in
blue liveries. They dine and stop all night.
A pretty bill there will be to-morrow, for the
servants are not on board wages.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Plague take the Green Dragon! How
did you discover that they are not on board
wages?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> I was curious to know, and asked one
of them. You know I never miss any thing for
want of asking. ’Tis no fault of mine that the
nabob is not here, at your house.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Why, what had you to do with it?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> You know I never forget my friends.
I stopped the carriage as it was coming down
the hill—brought it to a dead stop, and said
that if his lordship—I took him for a lord at
once—that if his lordship intended to make any
stay, he couldn’t do better than to go to
Doubledot’s.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Well,—would you believe it?—out pops
a saffron-colored face from the carriage window,
and says, “You’re an impudent rascal for stopping
my carriage, and I’ll not go to Doubledot’s
if there’s another inn to be found within ten
miles of it!”</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> There, that comes of your confounded
meddling! If you had not interfered I should
have stood an equal chance with the Green
Dragon.</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> I’m very sorry; but I did it for the best.</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Did it for the best, indeed! Deuce
take you! By your officious attempts to serve,
you do more mischief in the neighborhood than
the exciseman, the apothecary, and the attorney,
all together.</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Well, there’s gratitude! Now, really,
I must go. Good-morning.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Paul Pry</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> I’m rid of him at last, thank fortune!
(<i><span class="smcap">Pry</span> re-enters.</i>) Well, what now?</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> I’ve dropped one of my gloves. Now,
that’s very odd—here it is in my hand all the
time!</p>

<p><i>Doub.</i> Go to confusion!</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pry.</i> Come, that’s civil! If I were the least
of a bore, now, it would be pardonable—But—Hullo!
There’s the postman! I wonder
whether the Parkins’s have got letters again to-day.
They have had letters every day this
week, and I can’t for the life of me think what
they can—(<i>Feels hastily in his pockets.</i>) By
the way, talking of letters, here’s one I took
from the postman last week for the colonel’s
daughter, Miss Eliza, and I have always forgotten
to give it to her. I dare say it is not of
much importance. (<i>Peeps into it—reads.</i>)
“Likely—unexpected—affectionate.” I can’t
make it out. No matter; I’ll contrive to take it
to the house—though I’ve a deal to do to-day.
(<i>Runs off and returns.</i>) Dear me! I had like
to have gone without my umbrella.</p>

<h3>THE RESOLVE OF REGULUS.—<i>Sargent.</i></h3>

<p>(Regulus, a Roman consul, having been defeated
in battle and taken prisoner by the Carthaginians,
was detained in captivity five years, and then sent on
an embassy to Rome to solicit peace, under a promise
that he would return to Carthage if the proposals
were rejected. These, it was thought, he would
urge in order to obtain his own liberty; but he
urged contrary and patriotic measures on his countrymen;
and then, having carried his point, resisted
the persuasions of his friends to remain in Rome,
and returned to Carthage, where a martyr’s death
awaited him. Some writers say that he was thrust into
a cask covered over on the inside with iron spikes,
and thus rolled down hill. The following scene presents
Regulus just as he has made known to his friends
in Rome his resolution to return to Carthage.)</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Billiards? No, I never play billiards.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i>B.</i> I don’t like its tendency.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is only a healthy pastime. I am sure it
has no evil tendency.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> I cannot assert that the game in its most
innocent form is, of itself, an evil, to be sure.
But, although it has the advantage of calling
forth skill and judgment, yet it is evil when it
excites and stimulates beyond the bounds of
healthy recreation.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That result can scarcely follow such a
game.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> You are wrong there. The result can
follow in two ways. First, it can lead men
away from their business. Secondly, it leads
those to spend money who have none to spend.
Look at that young man just passing. He
looks like a mechanic; and I should judge from
his appearance that he has a family. I see by
his face that he is kind and generous, and wants
to do as near right as he can. I have watched
him in the billiard saloon time after time, and
only last night I saw him pay one dollar and
forty cents for two hours’ recreation. He did
it cheerfully, too, and smiled at his loss. But
how do you suppose it is at home? Suppose
his wife had asked him for a dollar or two for
some household ornament, or his child, if he
has one, for a picture-book or toy, what do you
suppose he would have answered? This is not
conjecture; for you and I both know plenty of
such cases.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Upon my word, B., you speak to the
point; for I know that young man, and what
you have said is true. I can furnish you with
facts. We have a club for a literary paper in
our village, and last year he was one of the subscribers.
This year he was obliged to discontinue.
His wife was very anxious to take it;
but he said he could not afford the $1.25 for it.
And his little Lizzie, ten years old, has coaxed
her father for fifteen cents, for a hoop, in vain.
My Nellie told me that.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Yes; and that two hours’ recreation last
night, would have paid for both. It is well for
wives and children that they do not know where
all the money goes.</p>

had that introductory speech yet, and I
guess we are not going to get it. That was
the queerest kind of speech I ever heard. It
began, and then balked, and then kicked up,
and then braced its feet in front, and finally
stopped altogether. I think we would have
done better if we had started without any introduction,
just as grandpa said the other day
he thought Parson Goodwin ought to have
begun his sermon at the conclusion and left
out all that went before it.</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) Hold on there! You
say we don’t need any speech and yet you
are making a long one yourself. You said
that I hitched like a balky horse, but you
have kicked up your heels and cantered off
as if somebody had touched off a pack of
fire-crackers under you.</p>

<h3>QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS.</h3>

<p>(A dialogue for two men. From Act IV. of <i>Julius
Cæsar</i>. Before rendering the dialogue it is presumed
that the participants will read the whole play from a
volume of Shakespeare, and familiarize themselves
with the spirit of the selection. The interest will be
enhanced by the use of proper costumes. Where
these cannot be hired—as they generally may in
cities and large towns—they may be easily improvised
by observing the simple Roman dress as illustrated
in historical works.)</p>

<p>(Dialogue for elderly lady and young man. From
Act III. of the tragedy of <i>Hamlet</i>. The part of
<span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> is a very difficult one to play, and should
be thoroughly studied. The whole tragedy should
be read from Shakespeare, any illustrated volume of
which will suggest appropriate costume. The <span class="smcap">Ghost</span>
may be impersonated by a voice, unless a suitable
costume and staging are available.)</p>

<h3>LOCHIEL’S WARNING.</h3>

<p>(This piece is frequently recited by one person,
but is much more effective in dialogue. <span class="smcap">Lochiel</span>, a
Highland chieftain, while on his march to join the
Pretender, is met by one of the Highland seers, or
prophets, who warns him to return, and not incur
the certain ruin and disaster which await the unfortunate
prince and his followers on the field of Culloden.
When used as a dialogue, a blast of trumpet is
heard. The curtain being drawn, <span class="smcap">Lochiel</span> enters,
attired in the Highland fighting costume, and following
him should appear in the doorway of the stage
two or three armed Scotch soldiers to give the idea
of a large number behind them. The <span class="smcap">Seer</span> meets
him from the other direction, dressed in flowing
robes, and with long white hair and beard, and,
raising his hands in the attitude of warning, speaks
imploringly as follows:)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mary</span> and <span class="smcap">Talbot</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Talbot, Elizabeth will soon be here.
I cannot see her. Preserve me from this hateful
interview.</p>

<p><i>Talbot.</i> Reflect a while. Recall thy courage.
The moment is come upon which everything
depends. Incline thyself; submit to the necessity
of the moment. She is the stronger.
Thou must bend before her.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Before her? I cannot!</p>

<p><i>Tal.</i> Thou must do so. Speak to her humbly;
invoke the greatness of her generous heart;
dwell not too much upon thy rights. But see
first how she bears herself towards thee. I myself
did witness her emotion on reading thy
letter. The tears stood in her eyes. Her heart,
’tis sure, is not a stranger to compassion; therefore
place more confidence in her, and prepare
thyself for her reception.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Taking his hand.</i>) Thou wert ever
my faithful friend. Oh, that I had always remained
beneath thy kind guardianship, Talbot!
Their care of me has indeed been harsh. Who
attends her?</p>

<p><i>Tal.</i> Leicester. You need not fear him; the
earl doth not seek thy fall. Behold, the queen
approaches. (<i>Retires.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> and <span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) O heavens! Protect me!
her features say she has no heart!</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.</i>) Who is this
woman? (<i>Feigning surprise.</i>) Robert, who
has dared to—</p>

<p><i>Lei.</i> Be not angry, queen, and since heaven
has hither directed thee, suffer pity to triumph
in thy noble heart.</p>

<p><i>Tal.</i> (<i>Advancing.</i>) Deign, royal lady, to cast
a look of compassion on the unhappy woman
who prostrates herself at thy feet.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i><span class="smcap">Mary</span>, having attempted to approach <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>,
stops short, overcome by repugnance, her gestures
indicating internal struggle.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>Haughtily.</i>) Sirs, which of you spoke
of humility and submission? I see nothing but
a proud lady, whom misfortune has not succeeded
in subduing.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I will undergo even this last
degree of ignominy. My soul discards its noble
but, alas! impotent pride. I will seek to forget
who I am, what I have suffered, and will humble
myself before her who has caused my disgrace.
(<i>Turns to <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.</i>) Heaven, O sister, has
declared itself on thy side, and has graced thy
happy head with the crown of victory. (<i>Kneeling.</i>)
I worship the Deity who hath rendered
thee so powerful. Show thyself noble in thy
triumph, and leave me not overwhelmed by
shame! Open thy arms, extend in mercy to me
thy royal hand, and raise me from my fearful fall.</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>Drawing back.</i>) Thy place, Stuart, is
there, and I shall ever raise my hands in gratitude
to heaven that it has not willed that I
should kneel at thy feet, as thou now crouchest
in the dust at mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>With great emotion.</i>) Think of the
vicissitudes of all things human! There is a
Deity above who punisheth pride. Respect the
Providence who now doth prostrate me at thy
feet. Do not show thyself insensible and pitiless
as the rock, to which the drowning man,
with failing breath and outstretched arms, doth
cling. My life, my entire destiny, depend upon
my words and the power of my tears. Inspire
my heart, teach me to move, to touch thine own.
Thou turnest such icy looks upon me, that my
soul doth sink within me, my grief parches my
lips, and a cold shudder renders my entreaties
mute. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>Coldly.</i>) What wouldst thou say to me?
thou didst seek converse with me. Forgetting
that I am an outraged sovereign, I honor thee
with my royal presence. ’Tis in obedience to
a generous impulse that I incur the reproach of
having sacrificed my dignity.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> How can I express myself? how shall
I so choose every word that it may penetrate,
without irritating, thy heart? God of mercy!
aid my lips, and banish from them whatever may
offend my sister! I cannot relate to thee my
woes without appearing to accuse thee, and this
is not my wish. Towards me thou hast been
neither merciful nor just. I am thine equal,
and yet thou hast made me a prisoner, a suppliant,
and a fugitive. I turned to thee for aid,
and thou, trampling on the rights of nations and
of hospitality, hast immured me in a living tomb!
Thou hast abandoned me to the most shameful
need, and finally exposed me to the ignominy of
a trial! But, no more of the past; we are now
face to face. Display the goodness of thy heart!
tell me the crimes of which I am accused!
Wherefore didst thou not grant me this friendly
audience when I so eagerly desired it? Years
of misery would have been spared me, and this
painful interview would not have occurred in
this abode of gloom and horror.</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> Accuse not fate, but thine own wayward
soul and the unreasonable ambition of thy house.
There was no quarrel between us until thy most
worthy ally inspired thee with the mad and rash
desire to claim for thyself the royal titles and
my throne! Not satisfied with this, he then
urged thee to make war against me, to threaten
my crown and my life. Amidst the peace which
reigned in my dominions, he fraudulently excited
my subjects to revolt. But heaven doth protect
me, and the attempt was abandoned in despair.
The blow was aimed at my head, but ’tis on
thine that it will fall.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I am in the hand of my God, but thou
wilt not exceed thy power by committing a deed
so atrocious?</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> What could prevent me? Thy kinsman
has shown monarchs how to make peace with
their enemies! Who would be surety for thee
if, imprudently, I were to release thee? How
can I rely on thy pledged faith? Nought but
my power renders me secure. No! there can be
no friendship with a race of vipers.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Are these thy dark suspicions? To
thine eyes, then, I have ever seemed a stranger
and an enemy. If thou hadst but recognized
me as heiress to thy throne—as is my lawful
right—love, friendship, would have made me thy
friend—thy sister.</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> What affection hast thou that is not
feigned? I declare thee heiress to my throne!
Insidious treachery! In order, forsooth, to
overturn the state, and—wily Armida that thou
art—entrap within thy snares all the youthful
spirits of my kingdom, so that during my own
lifetime all eyes would turn towards thee—the
new constellation!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Reign on in peace! I renounce all
right to thy sceptre. The wings of my ambition
have long drooped, and greatness has no
longer charms for me. ’Tis thou who hast it all;
I am now only the shade of Mary Stuart! My
pristine ardor has been subdued by the ignominy
of my chains. Thou hast nipped my existence
in the bud. But pronounce those magnanimous
words for which thou cam’st hither; for I will
not believe that thou art come to enjoy the base
delight of insulting thy victim! Pronounce the
words so longed for, and say, “Mary, thou art
free! Till now thou hast known only my power;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
now know my greatness.” Woe to thee, shouldst
thou not depart from me propitious, beneficent,
like an invoked Deity. O sister! not for all
England, not for all the lands the vast ocean
embraces, would I present myself to thee with
the inexorable aspect with which thou now regardest
me!</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> At length thou confessest thyself vanquished!
Hast thou emptied thy quiver of the
artifices it contained? Hast thou no more assassins?
Does there not remain to thee one
single hero to undertake in thy defence the
duties of knight-errant? Gone, Mary, gone
forever are those days. Thou canst no longer
seduce a follower of mine; other causes now
inflame men’s hearts. In vain didst thou seek a
fourth husband among my English subjects;
they knew too well that thou murderest thy
husbands, as thou dost thy lovers.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Shuddering.</i>) O heavens! sister!
Grant me resignation.</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Leicester</span>, with contempt.</i>) Earl,
are these the boasted features, on which no mortal
eye could gaze with safety? Is this the beauty to
which no other woman’s could be compared? In
sooth, the reputation appears to have been easily
won. To be thus celebrated as the reigning beauty
of the universe seems merely to  infer that she has
been universal in the distribution of her favors.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah, ’tis too much.</p>

<p><i>Eliz.</i> (<i>With a smile of satisfaction.</i>) Now thou
showest thyself in thine own form. Till now
thou hast worn a mask.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>With dignified pride.</i>) They were
mere human errors that overcame my youth.
My grandeur dazzled me. I have nought to
conceal, nor deny my faults; my pride has ever
disdained the base artifices of vile intriguers.
The worst I ever did is known, and I may boast
myself far better than my reputation. But woe
to thee, thou malignant hypocrite, if thou ever
lettest fall the mantle beneath which thou concealest
thy shameless amours! Thou, the
daughter of Anne Boleyn, hast not inherited
virtue! The causes that brought thy sinful
mother to the block are known to all.</p>

<p><i>Tal.</i> (<i>Stepping between them.</i>) Is this, O Mary,
thine endurance? Is this thy humility?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Endurance? I have endured all that
a mortal heart can bear. Hence, abject humility!
Insulted patience, get ye from my heart!
And thou, my long pent-up indignation, break
thy bonds, and burst forth from thy lair! Oh,
thou gavest to the angry serpent his deadly
glance; arm my tongue with poisonous stings.</p>

<p><i>Tal.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.</i>) Forgive the angry
transports which thou hast thyself provoked.</p>

<p><i>Lei.</i> (<i>Inducing <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> to withdraw.</i>)
Hear not the ravings of a distracted woman.
Leave this ill—</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> The throne of England is profaned by
a base-born—the British nation is duped by a
vile pretender! If right did prevail, thou wouldst
be grovelling at my feet, for ’tis I who am thy
sovereign. (<i><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> retires. <span class="smcap">Leicester</span> and
<span class="smcap">Talbot</span> follow.</i>) She departs, burning with
rage, and with bitterness of death at heart.
Now happy I am! I have degraded her in
Leicester’s presence. At last! at last! After
long years of insult and contumely, I have at
least enjoyed a season of triumph. (<i>Sinks upon
the floor.</i>)</p>

<h3>A CASE OF INDIGESTION.</h3>

<p class="hanging tb"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i><span class="smcap">Dr. Gregory’s</span> study. A table and
two chairs.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Patient</span> (an unhappy Scotch merchant)
from left. <span class="smcap">Dr. Gregory</span> discovered reading
(on right).</i></p>

<p><i>Patient.</i> Good morning, Dr. Gregory! I’m
just come into Edinburgh about some law
business, and I thought when I was here, at
any rate, I might just as weel take your advice,
sir, about my trouble.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Pray, sir, sit down. (<i>Patient sits
on left.</i>) And now, my good sir, what may
your trouble be?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Indeed, doctor, I’m not very sure, but
I’m thinking it’s a kind of weakness that
makes me dizzy at times, and a kind of pinkling
about my stomach—I’m just na right.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> You are from the west country, I should
suppose, sir?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, sir; from Glasgow.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Ay, pray, sir, are you a glutton?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Heaven forbid, sir! I am one of the
plainest men living in the west country.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Then, perhaps, you are a drunkard?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> No, Dr. Gregory, thank Heaven, no
one can accuse me of that! I’m of the dissenting
persuasion, doctor, and an elder, so
you may suppose I’m na drunkard.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> I’ll suppose no such thing till you
tell me your mode of living. I’m so much
puzzled with your symptoms, sir, that I should
wish to hear in detail what you do eat and
drink. When do you breakfast, and what do
you take at it?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> I breakfast at nine o’clock; take a cup
of coffee, and one or two cups of tea, a couple
of eggs, and a bit of ham or kippered salmon,
or, maybe, both, if they’re good, and
two or three rolls and butter.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Do you eat no honey, or jelly, or jam,
at breakfast?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> O, yes, sir! but I don’t count that as
anything.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Come, this is a very moderate breakfast.
What kind of a dinner do you make?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> O, sir, I eat a very plain dinner, indeed.
Some soup, and some fish, and a little
plain roast or boiled; for I dinna care for
made dishes; I think, some way, they never
satisfy the appetite.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> You take a little pudding, then, and
afterwards some cheese?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> O, yes! though I don’t care much
about them.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> You take a glass of ale or porter with
your cheese?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, one or the other; but seldom
both.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> You west-country people generally
take a glass of Highland whiskey after dinner?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, we do; it’s good for digestion.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Do you take any wine during dinner?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, a glass or two of sherry; but I’m
indifferent as to wine during dinner. I drink
a good deal of beer.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> What quantity of port do you drink?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> O, very little; not above half a dozen
glasses or so.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> In the west country, it is impossible, I
hear, to dine without punch?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, sir; indeed, ’tis punch we drink
chiefly; but, for myself, unless I happen to
have a friend with me, I never take more
than a couple of tumblers or so, and that’s
moderate.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> O, exceedingly moderate, indeed!
You then, after this slight repast, take some
tea and bread and butter?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, before I go to the counting-house
to read the evening letters.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> And on your return you take supper,
I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> No, sir, I canna be said to take supper;
just something before going to bed;—a rizzered
haddock, or a bit of toasted cheese, or
a half-hundred oysters, or the like o’that, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
maybe, two-thirds of a bottle of ale; but I
take no <i>regular</i> supper.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> But you take a little more punch after
that?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> No, sir; punch does not agree with
me at bedtime. I take a tumbler of warm
whiskey-toddy at night; it is lighter to sleep
on.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> So it must be, no doubt. This, you
say, is your everyday life; but, upon great
occasions, you perhaps exceed a little?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> No, sir; except when a friend or two
dine with me, or I dine out, which, as I am a
sober family man, does not often happen.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Not above twice a week?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> No, not oftener.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Of course you sleep well and have a
good appetite?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Yes, sir, thank Heaven, I have; indeed,
any ill health that I have is about mealtime.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> (<i>Rising with a severe air—the <span class="smcap">Patient</span>
also rises.</i>) Now, sir, you are a very pretty
fellow, indeed! You come here and tell me
you are a moderate man; but, upon examination,
I find, by your own showing, that
you are a most voracious glutton. You said
you were a sober man; yet, by your own showing,
you are a beer-swiller, a dram-drinker, a
wine-bibber, and a guzzler of punch. You
tell me you eat indigestible suppers, and swill
toddy to force sleep. I see that you chew
tobacco. Now, sir, what human stomach can
stand this? Go home, sir, and leave your
present course of riotous living, and there are
hopes that your stomach may recover its tone,
and you be in good health, like your neighbors.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> I’m sure, doctor, I’m very much
obliged to you. (<i>Taking out a bundle of
bank notes.</i>) I shall endeavor to——</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i> Sir, you are not obliged to me:—put
up your money, sir. Do you think I’ll take
a fee for telling you what you know as well
as myself? Though you’re no physician, sir,
you are not altogether a fool. Go home, sir,
and reform, or, take my word for it, your life
is not worth half a year’s purchase.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Thank you, doctor, thank you. Good-day,
doctor.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit on right, followed by <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>.</i>)</p>

<h3>MR. CROSS AND SERVANT JOHN.</h3>

<p><i>Mr. Cross.</i> Why do you keep me knocking
all day at the door?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I was at work, sir, in the garden. As
soon as I heard your knock, I ran to open
the door with such haste that I fell down and
hurt myself.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Why didn’t you leave the door
open?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, sir, you scolded me yesterday
because I did so. When the door is open,
you scold; when it is shut, you scold. I
should like to know what to do?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> What to do? What to do, did you
say?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I said it. Shall I leave the door
open?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> No. I tell you, no!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Shall I keep the door shut?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Shall you keep the door shut? No,
I say.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> But, sir, a door must be either open
or——</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Don’t presume to argue with me,
fellow!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> But doesn’t it hold to reason that a
door——</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Silence, I say. Hold your tongue!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> And I say that a door must be either
open or shut. Now, how will you have it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I have told you a thousand times,
you provoking fellow—I have told you that I
wished it—— But what do you mean by
cross-questioning me, sir? Have you trimmed
the grape-vine, as I ordered you?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I did that three days ago, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Have you washed the carriage?
Eh?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I washed it before breakfast, sir, as
usual.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> You haven’t watered the horses to-day!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Go and see, sir, if you can make
them drink any more. They have had their
fill.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Have you given them their oats?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ask William; he saw me do it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> But you have forgotten to take the
mare to be shod. Ah! I have you now!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I have the blacksmith’s bill here.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> My letters!—Did you take them to
the post-office? Ha! You forgot, did you?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I forgot nothing, sir. The letters
were in the mail ten minutes after you handed
them to me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> How often have I told you not to
scrape on that abominable violin of yours?
And yet this very morning——</p>

<p><i>John.</i> This morning? You forget, sir. You
broke the violin all to pieces for me last Saturday
night.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I’m glad of it! Come, now; that
wood which I told you to saw and put into
the shed—why is it not done? Answer me!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> The wood is all sawed, split, and
housed, sir; besides doing that, I have watered
all the trees in the garden, dug over
three of the beds, and was digging another
when you knocked.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Oh, I must get rid of this fellow!
He will plague my life out of me. Out of my
sight, sir! (<i>John rushes out.</i>)</p>

<h3>HOW TO BREAK BAD NEWS.</h3>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Ha, steward! how are you, my old
boy? How do things go on at home?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Bad enough, your honor; the
magpie’s dead.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Poor Mag! so he’s gone. How
came he to die?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Over-ate himself, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Did he, indeed? a greedy villain!
Why, what did he get he liked so well?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Horse-flesh, sir; he died of eating
horse-flesh.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> How came he to get so much
horse-flesh?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> All your father’s horses, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> What! are they dead, too?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Ay, sir; they died of over-work.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> And why were they over-worked,
pray.</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> To carry water, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> To carry water! What did they
carry water for?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Sure, sir, to put out the fire.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Fire! What fire?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Oh, sir, your father’s house is
burned to the ground.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> My father’s house! How come it
set on fire?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> I think, sir, it must have been the
torches.</p>

<p><i>Mr. H.</i> Torches! What torches?</p>

<p class="dropcap">All permanent associations formed for
mutual benefit must have a Constitution
by which they shall be governed.</p>

<p>Where it is intended to organize a society for
the intellectual improvement or social enjoyment
of its members, a number of persons meet
together and select a name for the organization.
The next step is to appoint a committee, whose
duty it shall be to prepare a <i>Constitution</i> and
code of <i>By-Laws</i> for the society. These must
be reported to the society at its next meeting,
and must be adopted by the votes of a majority
of that body before they can take effect.</p>

<p>The Constitution consists of the rules which
form the foundation upon which the organization
is to rest. It should be brief and explicit.
It should be considered and adopted section by
section; should be recorded in a book for that
purpose, and should be signed by all the members
of the society.</p>

<p>Amendments to the Constitution should be
adopted in the same way, and should be signed
by each member of the society.</p>

<p>In addition to the Constitution, it is usual
to adopt a series of minor rules, which should
be explanatory of the principles of the Constitution.
These are termed <i>By-Laws</i>, and should
be recorded in the same book with the Constitution,
and immediately after it. New by-laws
may be added from time to time, as the necessity
for them may arise. It is best to have as few as
possible. They should be brief, and as clear
that their meaning may be easily comprehended,
and should govern the action of the body.</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>As growth and development of mind, together
with readiness and fluency of speech, are the
result of investigation and free discussion of
religious, education, political, and other topics,
the undersigned agree to form an association,
and for its government, do hereby adopt the
following Constitution:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article I.</span>—The name and title of this
organization shall be</p>

<p class="center">“The Philomathian Literary Society,”</p>

of diffusing knowledge among its members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article II.</span>—The officers of the Association
shall consist of a President, two Vice-Presidents,
a Corresponding Secretary, a Recording Secretary,

their position until their successors are elected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article III.</span>—It shall be the duty of the
President to preside at all public meetings of the
Society. The first Vice-President shall preside
in the absence of the President, and in case of
the absence of both President and Vice-President,
it shall be the duty of the second Vice-President
to preside.</p>

<p>The duty of the Secretary shall be to conduct

the work done at the preceding meeting.</p>

weekly, and at such other times as a majority,
consisting of at least five members of the Association,

<p><span class="smcap">Article VII.</span>—It shall be the duty of the

calculated to bring this Association into
disrepute, shall be expelled from the membership
of the Society by a two-thirds vote of the
members present at any regular meeting. No
member shall be expelled, however, until he
shall have had notice of such intention on the
part of the Association, and has been given an
opportunity of being heard in his own defense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article X.</span>—By giving written notice of
change at any regular meeting, this Constitution

</div>

<h3>JOAN OF ARC AT THE STAKE.</h3>

<h4>CHARACTER AND COSTUME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Maiden.</span>—Loose, white robe, wing-like sleeves, displaying
arm; hair long, loose, and flowing over
shoulders.</p>

<h4>THE TABLEAU.</h4>

<p>A large post in centre of stage, around
which are piled fagots. Fastened to the post
by means of a chain around the waist stands
the maiden, with eyes cast upward, and the
whole attitude that of exaltation. A strong
red light suddenly thrown upon the lower
part of the picture, from both sides, will produce
the effect of ignited wood.</p>

<p>Music, if any, triumphant.</p>

<h3>WINTER IN THE LAP OF SPRING.</h3>

<h4>CHARACTERS AND COSTUMES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Winter.</span>—Black, loose dress to the feet, fur cap,
white wig, and long white beard; dress flecked with
bits of cotton, to represent snow; face full and florid.
The part may be taken by a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spring.</span>—Trailing loose dress of white, sleeves
draped so as to show arm to elbow; scarf and sash
of pink; long, flowing, yellow hair; sprays of roses
and other flowers gracefully fastened on the dress;
wealth of flowers on the head.</p>

<h4>THE TABLEAU.</h4>

<p>Spring is seated on a chair, over which may
be thrown a covering of white or pink, upon
which are scattered profusely sprays of flowers.
She holds at her side a golden sceptre.</p>

<p>Winter is seated in the lap of Spring holding
extended in his right hand a sceptre of black.</p>

<h3>THERE’S NO ROSE WITHOUT A THORN.</h3>

<p>The scene is a parlor.—Standing in the
foreground is a young girl, simply dressed.
In her left hand she has a rose, and holding
out her right hand shows to her companion
the scratches made by the thorns (a little
carmine paint, put on with a fine camel’s-hair
pencil, makes very painless scratches.) Her
companion, a young man dressed as a mechanic’s
apprentice (a carpenter’s, butcher’s,
shoemaker’s or any other trade), is, with a
look of sympathy, raising the wounded hand
to his lips. Behind the young man stands his
employer, with an expression of rage, raising
a rope about to strike the apprentice. He is
not perceived by either of the young people.</p>

<p>In the background is a child, with a
look of great glee, putting its fingers into
a jar, marked jam, while the mother, behind
the child, is raising her hand to box its ears.</p>

<h3>A NUN AT HER DEVOTIONS.</h3>

<p>It hardly needs description. A background
of dark brown gauze, very faintly
lighted at the upper right-hand corner; a
dress of black serge or stuff, with black veil
and white coif; a crucifix and rosary—these
are the very simple materials needed. Let
the light fall from the left-hand upper corner
in front. Choose your nun for the beauty
of her eyes, the regularity and refinement of
feature, and the elegance of her hands.</p>

<h3>TABLEAU WITH RECITALS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Characters.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poet.</span>—A young man with long hair and wide linen

<h3>CINDERELLA’S SLIPPER.</h3>

<p>(This beautiful tableau may be represented in
three or four scenes, with fine dress effect.)</p>

<h4>SCENE I.</h4>

<p>Cinderella meanly clad, the sisters and Prince in
costliest attire. One of the sisters is eagerly
bent on forcing her foot into the slipper.</p>

<p>A very large shoe, which she has just vacated,
is on the floor beside her. The other,
her face and attitude showing keenest disappointment,
has just put on her shoe.
These shoes, while nicely made, should be
the largest that can be had. The slipper may
be of white satin, small and handsome.</p>

<h4>SCENE II.</h4>

<p>Cinderella, having begged permission to
try on the slipper, has just seated herself,
withdrawn her shoe and placed a dainty foot
on the cushion beside the slipper. The sisters
give her a scornful and reproachful look.</p>

<h4>SCENE III.</h4>

<p>Cinderella, having put on the slipper, has
just drawn from her pocket its mate. The
sisters, bewildered and dumfounded, have
thrown themselves at her feet. This scene
makes a fitting conclusion to the performance,
and the next two scenes should not be
attempted unless the appliances are at hand to
make Cinderella imagination’s richest queen.</p>

<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>

<p>The fairy has touched her clothes with the
magic wand, and Cinderella has become a
being of marvelous beauty. Her gorgeous
splendor dazzles the eyes of the Prince. She
helps her sisters to their feet, and shows, as
before, no resentment for past insult.</p>

<h4>SCENE V.</h4>

<p>Cinderella and the Prince, arm in arm, prepare
to leave the stage, followed by the sisters.</p>

<h3>LISTENERS HEAR NO GOOD OF THEMSELVES.</h3>

<p>The scene is a parlor.—In the foreground
are two young girls, one of whom holds a miniature
out to the other, who puts it aside, with an
expression of angry contempt. The first girl
is laughing heartily, and pointing her finger at
the second, as if teasing her about the picture.</p>

<p>Peeping out from behind a window-curtain
is a young man, who, with an expression of
perfect rage, is shaking his fist at the ladies.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
